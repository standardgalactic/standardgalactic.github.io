Identity Collapse and the Platforming of Fraud:
Structural Trust Degradation in Facebook's Design
Flyxion
1
Introduction
The persistence of fraud, the erosion of institutional trust, and the normalization of deception on
Facebook are often framed as problems of moderation capacity, malicious users, or unfortunate side
effects of unprecedented scale. This framing is inadequate. The central claim of this essay is that
these outcomes are neither accidental nor emergent in any strong sense, but rather the predictable
and foreseeable consequences of architectural decisions that weaken identity constraints, incentivize
imitation, and optimize interaction without regard to legitimacy.
A growing body of scholarship has documented how engagement-optimized platforms extract
attention as a resource while externalizing social cost (Wu 2016; Zuboff 2019). Within such systems,
behavioral metrics displace normative constraints, and optimization targets replace truth, trust, or
accountability as governing principles. Facebook exemplifies this logic at planetary scale. By per-
mitting non-unique identities, encouraging uncredited remixing of personal and commercial media,
constraining user refusal, and coupling monetization promises to structurally unattainable thresholds,
the platform converts trust into an extractable commodity rather than a conserved social resource.
These dynamics were not discovered retroactively. They were visible to ordinary users almost
immediately and have been repeatedly documented by journalists, researchers, and internal whistle-
blowers (Haugen 2021; Horwitz and Seetharaman 2021). That they persist reflects not uncertainty but
prioritization. The system does not merely fail to prevent scams. It creates an environment in which
scamming becomes adaptive, automated, and economically rational.

Identity as a Degraded Namespace
At the foundation of any trust-bearing information system lies a basic requirement: identities must
be uniquely bound to histories. This requirement is not ethical but structural. Without persistent, in-
jective mappings between identifiers and entities, attribution becomes probabilistic and accountabil-
ity collapses. Facebook systematically violates this requirement by allowing individuals, businesses,
and organizations to share identical names, profile images, and visual branding without meaningful
namespace separation.
Economic theory predicts the consequences of such ambiguity. In environments where quality
signals cannot be reliably distinguished, low-quality and deceptive actors drive out legitimate ones,
1

producing what Akerlof famously described as a market for lemons (Akerlof 1970). On Facebook,
this logic manifests not only in commercial exchange but in social identity itself. Pages named after
real businesses or public figures routinely appear with no followers, no engagement history, and no
provenance, yet are visually indistinguishable from the entities they impersonate.
Over time, this saturates the platform with low-credibility replicas, degrading trust not only in
Facebook as an intermediary but in online identity as a concept. Trust ceases to be an accumulated
property grounded in continuity and instead becomes a fleeting inference drawn from surface re-
semblance. As Lessig argued in an earlier era of digital governance, architecture is law (Lessig 1999).
When the architecture refuses to enforce identity integrity, impersonation becomes a native operation
rather than an edge case.
3
Remix Culture as Identity Laundering
Facebook's promotion of unrestricted remixing, resharing, and reposting of images, videos, and music
further accelerates identity degradation. While presented as participatory creativity, this policy func-
tions in practice as identity laundering. Content circulates divorced from authorship, context, and
provenance, allowing credibility to be transferred without accountability. What appears as cultural
openness in fact operates as a mechanism for stripping signals of origin.
This dynamic disproportionately benefits malicious actors. Scammers are not required to establish
trust through sustained behavior. They merely appropriate it by proximity, repackaging familiar
imagery or viral media to inherit emotional resonance and perceived legitimacy. Engagement-based
ranking systems reward this behavior, as remixed content often performs better than original material
under metrics optimized for interaction rather than integrity (Campbell 1979; Goodhart 1975).
The broader epistemic consequence is a degradation of contextual integrity. As Nissenbaum has
argued, information derives meaning from its normative context of flow (Nissenbaum 2010). When
content is systematically detached from its origins, audiences are trained to accept attribution loss as
normal, while creators experience the erosion of authorship as a structural condition rather than an
aberration. The result is an environment in which legitimacy is endlessly transferable and therefore
increasingly meaningless.
4
Forced Exposure and the Impossibility of Refusal
Ethical systems require the possibility of refusal. On Facebook, this possibility is deliberately con-
strained. Users cannot reliably disable entire content classes such as reels, cannot permanently reduce
advertising density, and cannot effectively block categories of interaction that repeatedly violate their
preferences. Blocking operates locally and transiently, while exposure operates globally and persis-
tently.
This asymmetry ensures that engagement is not chosen but extracted. Attention becomes com-
pulsory rather than voluntary, and users are subjected to algorithmically injected content regardless
of expressed intent. As Wu has shown, attention markets historically rely on scarcity and coercion
2

rather than consent (Wu 2016). Facebook extends this logic into the digital domain by making refusal
costly, incomplete, or illusory.
From the perspective of governance, this is not a usability flaw but a revenue requirement. Guar-
anteed impression volume underwrites advertising markets and monetization schemes. The inability
to opt out is therefore not accidental. It is a prerequisite for the platform's economic model, which
treats user attention as a resource to be allocated rather than an agency to be respected (Zuboff 2019).
5
Monetization as Coercive Hope
Facebook's monetization architecture exemplifies a particularly insidious form of extraction that op-
erates through aspirational signaling rather than direct coercion. Pages and creators are encouraged
to pursue monetization through dashboards, notifications, and prompts that imply attainability and
progress. Yet the actual requirements for eligibility remain prohibitively high, opaque, and frequently
retroactive. Creators often discover only after sustained labor that they must maintain tens of thou-
sands of followers, produce specific content formats such as reels, and meet engagement thresholds
that reset on short time horizons.
This structure functions as coerced hope. Labor is extracted in advance, visibility is rationed al-
gorithmically, and failure is individualized rather than attributed to systemic throttling. When reach
collapses, creators are offered paid promotion as a remedy, effectively charging users to recover vis-
ibility that was artificially withheld. This dynamic exemplifies Goodhart's Law: when engagement
metrics become targets, they cease to function as meaningful measures of value (Goodhart 1975).
What is optimized is not quality or trust, but metric performance divorced from substance.
The broader political economy of this arrangement resembles what Varoufakis has described as
technofeudal dependency, in which access to audiences is controlled by platform lords who extract
rent from aspirational labor (Varoufakis 2023). Cory Doctorow has similarly argued that platforms
enclose the means of computation and then sell partial relief from the constraints they themselves
impose (Doctorow 2023). In this context, monetization does not reward excellence. It monetizes
desperation.
6
Advertising Saturation and Institutional Erosion
Advertising on Facebook is not merely frequent; it is structurally invasive. Sponsored content appears
at regular intervals regardless of user behavior, and blocking individual advertisers does not reduce
ad density. It merely triggers replacement. The rate remains constant while the quality often declines.
Many advertisements are themselves scams, low-quality dropshipping schemes, or impersonations of
legitimate businesses.
This saturation produces what may be described as epistemic pollution. When deceptive content
becomes ambient background noise, users lose the ability to treat any signal as reliable. Trust collapses
not because deception is rare, but because it is ubiquitous. As Akerlof's analysis predicts, when low-
quality signals dominate, high-quality actors withdraw or are ignored (Akerlof 1970). The platform
3

benefits from this collapse insofar as skepticism toward organic content increases dependence on paid
amplification and platform-mediated verification.
Network theory suggests that such effects scale nonlinearly. As platforms grow, local trust fail-
ures propagate through dense connectivity, amplifying institutional erosion across the network (Barabási
2016). What begins as annoyance becomes cynicism, and what begins as cynicism becomes disengage-
ment from institutions altogether. The harm is therefore not confined to individual users but diffuses
outward into the broader social fabric.
7
Scam Recycling and Platform Incentives
When scams are reported and removed from Facebook, the response is intentionally incomplete. Ac-
counts are deleted, but IP addresses, behavioral signatures, and reuse patterns are not meaningfully
constrained. This allows scammers to reappear almost immediately under new names, often with
improved tactics refined through prior failures. Each iteration generates advertising revenue, engage-
ment metrics, or transaction fees before eventual removal.
This dynamic creates a profound learning asymmetry. Attackers learn globally across attempts,
while the platform forgets locally at each deletion. As Elad's work on sparse and redundant repre-
sentations suggests, adversarial actors adapt rapidly in underconstrained environments, exploiting
gaps left by brittle classifiers (Elad 2010). Removal without memory functions as negative learning.
It erases information that could have constrained future abuse.
Internal documents and whistleblower testimony indicate that these patterns are well understood
within the company (Haugen 2021; Horwitz and Seetharaman 2021). Their persistence therefore
cannot be attributed to ignorance. The platform's refusal to impose durable consequences is not
neutral. It actively subsidizes fraud by lowering the cost of iteration and externalizing harm onto users.
Over time, scammers become more automated, more persuasive, and more desperate, escalating both
sophistication and volume. Fraud, under these conditions, is not an anomaly. It is an equilibrium.
8
Metric Gamification and the Simulation of Legitimacy
In the absence of reliable identity and historical continuity, Facebook substitutes metric performance
for legitimacy. Likes, followers, views, and engagement ratios are treated as proxies for trust de-
spite being trivially manipulable. This substitution is predictable. When direct signals of quality are
unavailable, users infer credibility from visible counters, regardless of their provenance (Campbell
1979).
The result is a gamified legitimacy economy in which appearances dominate outcomes. Empty
pages, engagement farms, and deceptive growth tactics flourish, while honest actors are penalized
for refusing manipulation. Legitimacy is no longer conserved through behavior. It is manufactured,
traded, and exhausted. As Simon warned in his analysis of information-rich environments, cognitive
overload forces reliance on simplified heuristics that systems can easily exploit (Simon 1971).
4

This simulation of legitimacy completes the scam pipeline. Quantitative activity is converted into
qualitative trust, which is then monetized. The platform's metrics do not merely measure behavior.
They shape it, selecting for actors who optimize surface signals rather than substantive contribution.
Trust degradation, in this sense, is not a side effect of metricization. It is its logical conclusion.
9
Formal Systems Interpretation
From the perspective of formal systems theory, Facebook may be understood as an identity-processing
automaton that operates without injective mappings. In any well-formed symbolic system, references
must map uniquely and persistently to histories in order for inference to be sound. When multiple
entities share indistinguishable names, images, and surface features, the system abandons injectivity
and instead permits many-to-one and one-to-many mappings between symbol and referent. This
violates the basic conditions required for reliable reasoning.
In such a system, truth becomes undecidable at the interface level. Users are not provided with suf-
ficient information to distinguish authentic states from counterfeit ones because the representational
grammar does not encode disambiguation. The platform therefore behaves like a non-deterministic
machine whose outputs cannot be verified without external context that the system itself suppresses.
Fraud does not exploit a loophole in this architecture; it exploits the architecture itself.
The removal of historical continuity further transforms the platform into a memoryless process.
Accounts may be deleted, renamed, or repurposed without preserving a persistent event record acces-
sible to other participants. In formal terms, state transitions are permitted without conservation laws.
As Shannon's theory of communication makes clear, information that is not preserved cannot be re-
covered, and noise accumulates as a result (Shannon 1948). By discarding identity history in favor of
throughput, the platform erases the very invariants required to constrain adversarial behavior.
This loss of invariants produces emergent pathologies at scale. As Anderson famously observed,
qualitative changes arise when quantitative scale crosses critical thresholds (Anderson 1972). What
might appear as tolerable ambiguity in small systems becomes catastrophic in global ones. Bad actors
are not merely tolerated but rendered structurally indistinguishable from good ones, because the
system refuses to encode the information necessary to tell them apart.
10
Thermodynamic Framing of Trust and Entropy
Trust within a social system behaves analogously to a low-entropy resource. It accumulates slowly
through consistent behavior, verified identity, and historical continuity, and it dissipates rapidly under
conditions of ambiguity and deception. Facebook operates as a high-entropy engine that converts
trust gradients into engagement flows. Identity ambiguity, metric gamification, and forced exposure
function as entropy injectors that accelerate the decay of reliable signals.
In this framing, scams act as localized entropy spikes that the platform neither contains nor damp-
ens. Instead of isolating these regions and preventing recurrence, the system allows entropy to diffuse
across the network, raising the baseline noise level. As entropy increases, users become less able to
5

discriminate signal from noise, and the marginal cost of deception decreases. This favors actors who
externalize harm and penalizes those who invest in coherence.
The platform does not merely tolerate entropy production. It profits from it. Each instance of
confusion generates additional engagement, reporting interactions, ad impressions, or monetization
attempts. The system thus violates any analogue of a second law that would require entropy to be
bounded or compensated. Instead, disorder becomes a revenue source. As studies of critical transi-
tions suggest, systems that allow unchecked entropy accumulation eventually undergo irreversible
phase shifts (Scheffer et al. 2009). In the present case, the terminal state is semantic saturation, in
which all content appears equally unreliable and trust collapses as a meaningful variable.
11
Indictment of Engagement-Optimized Governance
Engagement-optimized governance replaces normative constraints with behavioral metrics. Deci-
sions are evaluated not by their effect on truth, safety, or trust, but by their contribution to measurable
interaction. Under this regime, harm is acceptable provided it is engaging, and deception is tolerated
provided it sustains activity. Governance becomes a function of throughput rather than stewardship.
Facebook exemplifies this logic by structuring remediation mechanisms to be minimally disrup-
tive to engagement flows. Reporting interfaces constrain expression to predefined categories that
suppress novel or systemic harms. Blocking tools operate at the individual level and are deliberately
isolated, preventing the emergence of collective defense. Scam removal is reactive and transient, cal-
ibrated to placate complaints without altering underlying incentives. As Tufekci has argued, such
algorithmic governance systems exhibit forms of agency that escape traditional accountability frame-
works (Tufekci 2015).
This mode of governance is not neutral. It constitutes a choice to privilege short-term behavioral
extraction over long-term system viability. By refusing to encode trust-preserving constraints into
the platform's architecture, Facebook effectively governs by entropy maximization. The resulting en-
vironment selects for manipulation, automation, and escalation, while rendering ethical participation
increasingly costly and irrational.
The ethical failure here is not that scams occur, but that the system learns from them. Each success-
ful deception informs future optimization, while each victim subsidizes the refinement of extraction
strategies. Fraud, in this environment, is not an anomaly but a rational strategy. Trust degradation is
not a side effect but a feature.
12
Toward Constraint-Restoring Architectures
If the failures described thus far were merely emergent or accidental, remediation might plausibly
require novel technologies or unprecedented forms of governance. This is not the case. The core
problem is not a lack of sophistication but a refusal to enforce constraints that are already well under-
stood in other domains of computing and institutional design. Any meaningful reform must therefore
begin by restoring structural constraints rather than by intensifying content moderation.
6

One such constraint concerns expressive reporting. Current reporting mechanisms force users to
select from narrow taxonomies that suppress context and novelty, rendering systemic harms illegible
by design. A system that cannot represent a problem cannot learn from it. Allowing full narrative
reports, preserved as first-class objects linked to outcomes, would not only improve detection but
also create an auditable record of institutional response. The absence of such mechanisms reflects
prioritization choices rather than technical impossibility.
Equally important is the restoration of collective defense. Blocking, reporting, and detection cur-
rently operate at the level of isolated individuals, forcing each user to rediscover the same threats
independently. This asymmetry benefits attackers, who learn globally, while victims learn locally.
Network science suggests that defensive information propagates more effectively when shared across
connected nodes (Barabási 2016). Enabling shared block lists and scam signatures would reverse this
asymmetry, allowing trust-preserving signals to scale.
Most fundamentally, platforms must adopt event-historical architectures in which identities are
inseparable from their action histories. Accounts should function as append-only ledgers rather than
disposable shells. Name changes, removals, and enforcement actions must remain legible as part of
a public record. Without historical persistence, enforcement cannot generalize, and without gener-
alization, deterrence fails. These principles are commonplace in safety-critical systems, where error
logs are preserved precisely to prevent recurrence (Simon 1971).
13
Identity as Namespace
In any coherent information system, identity must function as a namespace rather than as a mutable
label. A namespace enforces uniqueness, persistence, and referential stability. It ensures that symbols
map to histories rather than to appearances, and that actions can be attributed without ambiguity.
When identity is treated merely as display content, stripped of structural constraints, the system
forfeits its ability to support trust, accountability, or meaning.
Facebook's architecture explicitly rejects identity as namespace. Names are non-unique, visual
representations are easily duplicated, and accounts may be renamed or repurposed without preserving
a publicly legible history. Identity is treated as content rather than as structure and is therefore
optimized for engagement in the same way as posts, images, or videos. Once identity itself becomes
subject to metric pressure, it is inevitably gamed. Scammers and impersonators are not deviating
from the system's logic. They are executing it efficiently.
The collapse of identity as namespace produces cascading failures. Attribution becomes unreli-
able, reporting loses specificity, and enforcement actions fail to generalize because they are applied to
disposable shells rather than to persistent entities. When an account is removed without preserving
its event history, the system deletes information that could have constrained future abuse. This is
analogous to deleting error logs in a safety-critical system while leaving the fault unaddressed.
Attempts to layer verification badges, reputation scores, or machine-learning classifiers atop a
broken namespace cannot restore coherence. Such measures add complexity without addressing the
underlying category error. As Floridi has argued, informational environments require structural in-
7

tegrity at the level of representation, not merely post hoc correction (Floridi 2014). Without identity
as namespace, higher-order governance remains impossible.
14
Axiomatic Foundations
The arguments advanced in this work rest on a set of structural axioms concerning identity, trust, and
system behavior. These axioms are not normative prescriptions but descriptive constraints required
for any system that purports to support coherent social interaction at scale.
The axiom of identity persistence holds that an identity must remain bound to its action history.
Any operation that allows an identity to discard or obscure its past without preserving public trace-
ability constitutes an information loss that degrades accountability. The axiom of namespace unique-
ness requires that identity symbols map injectively to entities within the system's domain. When
this condition is violated, attribution becomes probabilistic and impersonation becomes structurally
enabled.
The axiom of historical legibility requires that identity histories remain visible to other partici-
pants. Enforcement actions that erase rather than record history destroy the evidence required for
trust calibration. The axiom of constraint precedence states that structural constraints must be en-
forced prior to optimization. Systems that optimize engagement before establishing identity integrity
and accountability will inevitably amplify exploitative behaviors. Finally, the axiom of entropy bound-
edness requires that trust entropy be actively constrained. When deception and ambiguity recur with-
out durable suppression, disorder accumulates faster than corrective mechanisms can dissipate it.
Together, these axioms define the minimum conditions under which trust can exist as a conserved
quantity rather than a fleeting illusion. Their violation does not produce isolated harms but induces
systemic pathologies that scale with participation. The observed failures of large social platforms are
therefore not anomalies or moderation lapses but predictable consequences of axioms that were never
enforced.
15
Scam Amplification as a Structural Theorem
The axioms articulated above admit a set of unavoidable consequences that may be stated in theorem-
like form. These consequences are not empirical generalizations contingent on particular actors or
moments in time, but logical entailments of the system's structural properties. Scam amplification,
in this sense, is not an unfortunate byproduct of scale but a predictable outcome of engagement-
optimized architectures that violate identity and constraint axioms.
When identity persistence and namespace uniqueness are absent, impersonation-based fraud
emerges as a dominant strategy. The cost of impersonation approaches zero while the potential payoff
remains bounded below by basic human trust heuristics. Under such conditions, rational adversaries
converge on deceptive tactics because no countervailing structural penalty exists within the system.
As Akerlof's analysis would predict, low-cost deception crowds out high-cost honesty (Akerlof 1970).
8

Local enforcement without historical continuity further guarantees scam persistence. Each en-
forcement action removes only a surface instantiation while erasing information that could have
constrained future abuse. Attackers learn globally across attempts, while the platform forgets lo-
cally at each deletion. This asymmetry ensures that successive scam iterations improve over time.
Elad's work on adversarial adaptation in underconstrained representational spaces provides a useful
analogy: when detection is brittle and memoryless, attackers exploit sparsity and iterate faster than
defenses can adapt (Elad 2010).
Engagement-coupled distribution then amplifies these behaviors superlinearly with platform size.
Content ranking systems optimized for interaction preferentially elevate emotionally salient, urgent,
or manipulative signals, precisely the features exploited by scams. As networks grow denser, such
signals propagate more rapidly, while moderation capacity scales at best linearly (Barabási 2016). The
stable equilibrium of this dynamic is not containment but saturation.
16
Regulatory Interpretation and the Standard of Obvious Harm
From a regulatory perspective, the failures described in this work do not fall within the category
of unforeseen side effects or emergent complexity. They satisfy the standard of obvious harm. The
mechanisms by which identity ambiguity enables impersonation, by which engagement optimization
amplifies deception, and by which disposable accounts facilitate recidivism are neither subtle nor
novel. They are evident to any competent observer interacting with the system for even a short
period of time.
This places the platform in a condition of constructive knowledge. The harms are persistent,
widely reported, repeatedly documented, and directly observable through routine use. Whistleblower
testimony and internal research disclosures confirm that these effects were known within the organi-
zation long before they became matters of public controversy (Haugen 2021; Horwitz and Seethara-
man 2021). Under ordinary standards applied to infrastructure, finance, or consumer safety, such
knowledge would trigger an obligation to redesign the system. Continued operation without correc-
tion would be classified not as error but as negligence.
Claims that these problems are too complex to solve or require further study do not withstand
scrutiny. The underlying principles are elementary. Identity that is not unique cannot support at-
tribution. Enforcement that erases history cannot deter repeat abuse. Metrics that substitute for
legitimacy will be gamed. These are not esoteric insights. They are foundational concepts taught
in introductory computer science, systems engineering, and administrative law (Simon 1971; Lessig
1999). Their violation at planetary scale does not render them uncertain. It renders their consequences
more severe.
17
Second-Order and Adaptive Harms at Population Scale
Beyond direct fraud and deception, large-scale platform governance produces second-order harms
that operate through adaptive substitution and attentional displacement. When particular categories
9

of content are banned or heavily suppressed, including genuinely harmful material, the result is not
elimination but mutation. Actors rapidly generate near-isomorphic substitutes that evade detection
by differing just enough from what algorithms expect. This phenomenon is well understood in secu-
rity contexts: rigid classifiers incentivize camouflage.
At scale, this produces an arms race in which increasingly distorted, sensationalized, or obfuscated
content proliferates while enforcement mechanisms fall perpetually behind. The net effect is not
moral improvement but increased sophistication of deception. When entire domains of legitimate
informational content are restricted, such as news content in certain jurisdictions, engagement does
not decrease. It is redirected toward lower-quality substitutes, including tabloid fragments, outrage
clips, and low-information visual media that perform better under engagement metrics (Wu 2016;
Bridle 2018).
The cumulative effect of these substitutions is attentional degradation. Attention is diverted away
from activities that build long-term individual and societal capacity, such as learning languages, math-
ematics, engineering, medicine, or skilled trades, and toward content optimized for rapid consumption
and emotional reaction. Over long time horizons and across billions of users, this constitutes a system-
atic reallocation of cognitive resources. As Floridi has argued, polluted informational environments
degrade not only knowledge but agency itself (Floridi 2014).
18
Conclusion: Foreseeability, Responsibility, and the Possibility of Re-
pair
The failures analyzed in this work are not comparable to historical infrastructure disasters whose
harms were unknown or disputed at the time of deployment. Industrial pollutants and early public
health hazards were often introduced under conditions of genuine uncertainty. By contrast, the trust
degradation, fraud amplification, and attentional erosion produced by large-scale social platforms
were evident almost immediately and have remained visible throughout their operation.
The core mechanisms are simple and widely understood. Non-unique identity enables imper-
sonation. Disposable accounts enable recidivism. Engagement-optimized ranking amplifies decep-
tion. Suppressing structured information without altering incentives produces lower-quality substi-
tutes. These dynamics are observed by ordinary users through routine interaction, documented by
researchers and journalists, and acknowledged implicitly through reactive design changes. Foresee-
able harm imposes a higher standard of responsibility.
Equally important, the existence of harm does not imply the absence of solutions. Persistent
identity histories, expressive reporting mechanisms, shared defensive tools, and constraint-first ar-
chitectures are well within current technical capability. Many exist in other domains of computing
and governance. The platforms in question possess unparalleled volumes of data on abuse patterns,
scam recurrence, and attention dynamics. If these tools are insufficient to detect structural harm,
they are being misapplied. If they are sufficient but unused, the failure is institutional rather than
technical.
At planetary scale, infrastructure is destiny. When failures are foreseeable and repairs achievable,
10

responsibility is no longer abstract. It is immediate.
A
Addendum: Institutional Rebranding and Legitimacy Transfer
The identity dynamics described throughout this work are not confined to user behavior. They are
practiced at the institutional level by platform operators themselves. The corporate rebranding of
Facebook to Meta illustrates the same non-injective identity mapping observed in scam behavior,
whereby a persistent underlying entity adopts a new public identifier to shed accumulated reputa-
tional debt while preserving operational continuity.
This strategy is reinforced through association with high-prestige scientific and humanitarian
initiatives, such as the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, a nonprofit research organization founded by Mark
Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan to pursue ambitious goals in AI-powered biology. The value of such
work is not in question. What is structurally relevant is the transfer of legitimacy across domains.
Positive identity in one arena is allowed to offset negative identity in another despite the absence of
causal separation. This is identity remix at institutional scale.
That these techniques are employed openly underscores the foreseeability of the harms discussed
in this paper. The organization demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of how naming, affiliation,
and legitimacy function as transferable assets. The failure to enforce analogous constraints within its
own platforms therefore cannot plausibly be attributed to ignorance. It reflects selective application
of identity integrity, enforced where advantageous and relaxed where profitable.
