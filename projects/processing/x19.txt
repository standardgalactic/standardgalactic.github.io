He lodges near the College of Cambrai. It is unlikely that he then held any chair; if so, he would not have required such aid. The fact that his friends lived close to the College suggests it was where he had previously held a post. Moreover, the famous disputation, which will be discussed in due course, was held at the College and not at the Sorbonne.

It is true that the College of Cambrai was opposed to the...


Jesuits, and Bruno consulted a Jesuit. However, Prof. McIntyre is mistaken in supposing that he did so during his first visit to Paris. He did so during his second stay, at the instigation of the Spanish Ambassador.

Bruno was kindly received by his fellow-professors. At first, at least, his lectures were popular, and he speaks of the attendance of learned persons both at his public and private teachings. He made the acquaintance of Regnault, secretary to Henry of Angoulême, Grand Prior of France. Angoulême was the bastard son of Henry II by a Scots lady named Leviston, and therefore, was half-brother to the King.

Manuscript copies of Bruno’s second book, *The Chant of Circe*, were in circulation, and Regnault wished his friend to get the work printed. Since Bruno was


Occupied by weightier matters—namely, the instruction of the King—Regnault undertook its production, dedicating it to D’Angoulême. It appeared bound up with "The Shadow of Ideas." Among other influential persons he got to know was Giovanni Moro, the accomplished ambassador of Venice. Moro had just replaced Lorenzo Priuli, who was destined to preside over Bruno's trial in Venice; so Priuli may have known Bruno in Paris or heard of his reputation for heresy, which, as we shall see, was afloat.

He inscribed to Moro his "Substance and Completion of the Art of Lully."

"Lecturing and correcting proofs make heavy work in themselves; but Bruno's energy was unbounded and expended itself in close and continuous application. The same year which witnessed the publication of three Latin books saw that of a fourth, this time a comedy in Italian called 'The Chandler.'"

He was in royal favour, held a royal appointment, and was not unfriended at Court. Yet all was not so well...


He sat apart, a solitary thinker and somewhat disappointed man. Excommunication debarred him from his due. We learn how he was regarded or regarded himself from the title-page of his play: he is “il fastidito,” "the man with his stomach turned." But he has learned to accept life as it comes, with a serene outlook and even temper; he declares that he is cheery when sad and sad in cheer. Yet surely there is a sub-acid flavor in the announcement that he is "an academician of no academy"—he is that.


Strong, sad man who thinks for himself, therefore stands alone. It behooved him to walk warily; but Bruno was not a wary person. The Catholic Reaction was triumphant in Paris, and his printed books contained dubious doctrine.

It is hardly likely that his lectures were free from all offense. There had been a time when Ramus and Postel attacked Aristotle before crowded benches, and it was still possible to introduce new ideas under cover of the Stagirite.


Bruno's mantle had previously remained untouched by attacks against Aristotelian cosmology. Although Bruno once adhered to Aristotle's views, Copernicus compelled him to reconsider. 

Aristotle, as interpreted and taught by the schoolmen, was considered a cornerstone of Christian philosophy. The new science challenged several foundational teachings of the Church, and Bruno seized every chance to critique Aristotle on aspects that were typically unquestioned.

Scholars in the sixteenth century, much like poets, tended to be irritable. They often lacked breadth of vision and could become easily irritated. University students were undisciplined in their behavior; naturally gifted students were prone to turning lecture rooms into chaotic environments. Furthermore, Bruno was not cautious in social interactions—what brewed in his brain inevitably expressed itself.


On his tongue. In a somewhat confused manuscript record wherein he ran or was reported as running two separate stays in Paris together, he told the Inquisitors that he left France for England on account of tumults which were brewing.

However, from the peace of Fleix in 1580 to the outbreak of the war of the three Henrys in 1585, there was an almost complete lull in religious and political strife. Bruno must have been conscious that personal trouble loomed ahead. His scandalous doctrines got talked about. Opinions so unhallowed shocked every kind of Christian.
