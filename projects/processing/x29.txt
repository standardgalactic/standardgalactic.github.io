6 Eroi Ci, Argomento del Nonno.  
I N LONDON 97  

Service of mere perishable charms, whether of body or mind, so, with characteristic zeal and directness of attack and equally characteristic absence of prudence and tact, he sneers at “that Tuscan poet who displayed such spasms on the banks of the Sorgue for a lady of Vaucluse—though I do not desire to say he was mad.” No one who was not entirely insensitive to what might be passing in the mind of another could write thus. But Bruno was singularly defective in this regard, and ultimately it brought him to his end.

In the same dedicatory letter there occurs a paean of virility. It has been remarked that his tone is that of Walt Whitman; he is strenuous and invincible and male.

Falstaff might be addressing Prince Hal in the Eastcheap tavern when Bruno asks: “What do I hold! Am I perchance a foe to generation! Do I hate the sun!”


Regret having come into the world! Shall I keep men from the delicious fruit of our earthly paradise? Is it for me to bar the holy law of nature? Shall I try to set myself or others free from the sweet-bitter yoke that God, in His providence, has placed on our necks? Am I to persuade myself and others that we are not born to carry on the life we have received? Methinks I am not cold. I doubt if the snows of Caucasus would put out my fires. What do I conclude! It is Emment Knight who says we should render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's. That women, being women, should be honored and loved as such.

We should not forget that, like Mercutio, Bruno is "a gentleman that loves to hear himself talk." He will say more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.


Nevertheless, here was strange matter for Sidney's "wit, high, pure, divine" to digest. The work bears the date 1585.

A Spenser, Epitaph upon the Rt. Hon. Sir P. Sidney, G98

Giordano Bruno

Unless there was a side to his character which disappeared from our view in his apotheosis after Zutphen. And he is favored, a little farther on, with the unromantic avowal "made without blushing," that a woman is worthy of being loved in the flower of her beauty and ability to produce.


Children of Nature and God.

Still farther on, Nolan contrasts the sexual instinct with intellectual ardor. A strange address from a poet to a poet! But at least it shows that Bruno knew his patron to be broad-minded and tolerant. Sidney would perceive that Bruno was wholly incapable of covering up a single one of the many sides to his character and that he trusted in candor as the best possible title to consideration. It is evidence of the merit of both men—the sincerity of the suitor is matched by the tolerance of "a spotless friend, a matchless man, whose virtue ever shined."

Here in London, Bruno seems to have renewed his acquaintance with Gwynne and became friendly with John Florio, an Oxford man but an Italian by birth. He was the son of a refugee who was a Protestant preacher in this country. Florio introduces Bruno and an unidentified adversary at Oxford as Nolano and Torquato in "Second Frutets."


Published six years after Bruno’s departure from England. A follower and friend of Bruno’s was Alexander Dickson, who published “The Shadow of Reason” in the year of Bruno’s arrival in England. It is in Latin and is a mnemonic and Neo-Platonic work of little value, being but a poor imitation of Bruno’s Shadows of Ideas. Bruno says Dickson was as dear to him as his own soul. Among other adherents of “the Nolan” was one Smith, who became notable for his association with Bruno.

1 Called Torquato by Bruno himself in the Cena.

Bruno produced seven books while in England. The first of these, a treatise on the Lullian art, Mnemonics and Metaphysics in Latin, appeared in 1583. The second, entitled "The Ash-Wednesday Supper," aimed primarily to refute Aristotelian Physics and Astronomy and extend the Copernican conception; the third, "On Cause, Principle and the One," was a metaphysical work, and the fourth, "The Infinite Universe and Its Worlds."

In Italian, dedicated to Castelnau, it appeared in 1584. The "Supper" professes to have been printed in Paris; the "Cause" and the "Infinite Universe" at Venice. However, experts declare that all were issued from some unidentified London press.

Bruno told the Inquisitors: "All those which set forth on the title-page that they were printed at Venice were really printed in London. The printer wished it to appear that they were printed in Venice to secure a better sale and get them abroad more effectively. If it had been indicated that they were printed in England, their sale would have been more difficult. They were all printed in England although they bear the mark of Paris and elsewhere."
