**Summary of "The Monad"**

1. **The Distinction**: Giordano Bruno addresses the distinction between a limit or boundary and the physical body it bounds. For instance, he discusses the line as a series of atoms.

2. **Simplifying Geometry**: He attempted to simplify geometry by making much of it intuitively comprehensible through three complex figures.

**II. The Unit**

At an autumn fair, Wechel and Fischer released the remainder of the great poem. Permission for its printing is not recorded in the Frankfurt Censorial Register. It was entitled "Of the Unit, Quantity, and Shape: A Book Following 'The Five On The Least, The Great And Measure.' Also Eight Books Concerning The Innumerable, Immeasurable, and Indefinable, Or Of the Universe and Its Worlds."

In fact, two volumes were bound up in one. The first of these, *Of the Unit*, commences with laudatory verses addressed to Duke Henry Brunswick. Bruno contrasts the strenuous life of love for truth with that led by pleasure-seekers and the idle rich. It is clear that the long struggle with Obscurantists, the buffets of exile, persecution by academies, and the general ill success which attended his mission had left their marks. The iron had entered into his soul. Yet he is undaunted and sings with prophetic instinct:

“Whatever cruel fate shall await me,
the struggle began far back in
boyhood, and God be witness,
I follow the truth unvanquished, nor may death itself bear the slightest terror to
me, nor in any wise do I blench before the violence of any
mortal man.”

3 And later in the book, he sings:


“I have of my own works,

fought: it is much. Victory lies in the hands of Fate.  
Be that with me as it may, whosoever shall prove conqueror,  
future ages will not deny that I did not fear to die, was second to none in constancy, and preferred a spirited death to a craven life.”

Here, says Brunnhofer, is Bruno’s final statement.


**Epitaph**

There are many fine poetic passages, too often marred by ugly neologisms, curious syntax, and execrable prosody. Apart from these, the sole interest of the book to the modern reader lies in the singularity of that pronounced occultism which held so much attraction for men of the Renaissance. The scientific education of the day was not built on the secure foundation of careful observation and experiment. Stress was laid on word and symbol, with curious results. With greater sagacity, men put faith in intuitions springing from the mind, like Minerva from the brain of her Divine Father; but they knew little of the methods of verification.

Bruno draws largely from many sources in this work, but chiefly from Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim. He tells us that the work deals with revelation, faith, and divination, rather than with reasoned knowledge and experiment.


Ment. He takes occasion to protest against dogmas that disturb human calm and the peace of ages, put out the light of the mind, and avail not in morals.
