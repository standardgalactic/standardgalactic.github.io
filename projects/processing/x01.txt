GIOVANNI BRUNO  

CHAPTER I  
BIRTH AND PARENTAGE—BOYHOOD

A traveler, curious to try the local line which runs eastward from Naples, after journeying a few meandering miles through a generous and beautiful countryside, will find his train halting at the little city of Nola. Should he descend, he would not come across anything strikingly picturesque or architecturally memorable. There are few vestiges of the remote past; even the medieval cathedral is a restoration. On an eminence, a ruined fortress still dominates Campagna Felice, the "happy fields"—as the inhabitants call their plain—and, as of old times, the vineyards are lavish in the production of “mangiagerra,” a thick black wine. The sky is very lucid; the air sweet.


The eye may range over the rich and varied plain to Monte Somma (which hides Vesuvius) and to other guardian hills.
