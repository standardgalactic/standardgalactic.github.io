7 Cause, Dialogue iii and iv; Giordano Bruno's reasonings about an endless creation proceeding from within, rather than imposed by an external deity, and the individual mind as part of a universal spirit remained with him.


The servile assimilation of Aristotle by the Arabians soon ceased to commend itself. Of Avicebron’s "Fountain of Life," he had only indirect knowledge; however, he gathered its drift from comments and quotations. This led him to perceive that the Aristotelian categories of Form and Matter cannot be regarded as ultimate but require an underlying unity.

From Algazel, he learned how much habit has to do with the formation of belief. Sacred writings concern practice, not theory, and consequently employ the unscientific conceptions current at the time to enforce moral truth only.

He had to read the Fathers of the Church, who were regarded as important elements in the education of a Dominican monk. The intellectual discipline for such monks lay in subtle distinctions and metaphysical refinements of thought. In this respect, the schoolmen excel.


Men have exhibited such subtle discrimination; it was they who built up the triple wall of Catholic defense. The schoolmen were therefore studied by Bruno, whose acute mind appreciated the power and profundity of men who were so seriously handicapped by authority and by the jealous watchfulness of religion. Some years later, a Parisian scholar noted in his diary: "He (Bruno) ranks St. Thomas above all in his *Summa Contra Gentiles* and *Quaestiones Disputatae*. And, six years later, Bruno said: “I have nothing but admiration for him.”

**Discipline of Books I**

I have always held great respect for the doctors of the Catholic Church, and especially for St. Thomas Aquinas, whom—as I mentioned before—I have ever valued and loved as my own soul. As witness to the truth of what I say, you may read in my book *De Monarchia* these words: "Thomas Aquinas is the glory and illumination of all kinds of theologians and of peripatetic philosophy." This was mainly because he sought for a coherent body of truth, completing the work of his master, Albertus Magnus of Cologne.

Aquinas integrated Aristotle's logical works with Christian dogmas into a cohesive whole. He even attempted more boldly than Albrecht to condense all contemporary knowledge into an encyclopedic statement. The spirit of Aquinas still seems to haunt his ancient home in Naples and impresses itself on the best monks of his order. Bruno also admired Albertus Magnus (Albrecht of Cologne) and declared that he had no equal in his time, far surpassing Aristotle. Perhaps he rated this great schoolman so highly because of his little book on Alchemy; a subject which embraced much of the very limited knowledge of nature possessed by men in the thirteenth century.

However, except as an intellectual exercise or "whetstone," such study is among the least fruitful. The inadequacy of formal logic for scientific investigation becomes evident, although it proves useful for detecting errors.


It soon became apparent to Bruno that there was a flaw in deductive logic. Over and over again, in his works, he expressed scorn for the barren logic of the Peripatetics. They not only blindly followed Aristotle but also misconstrued him and avoided looking at natural things.

Could Aristotle have been summoned from the grave, he would have been with Bruno.

Perhaps as part of his theological education, Bruno applied himself to Hebrew. We know that he recited Psalm 86 in its original form before the Pope; he uses Hebrew letters as symbols and appears to have...

### The Neo-Platonists

When the literature of Hellas reached Italy in the previous century, the soil was ripe for its reception. Scholasticism had exhausted itself. Men were weary of dead distortions and desiccated dissections of reality, and they turned their eyes from the medieval museum to Plato, “the dove cleaving the thin air,” and to Plotinus, “the eagle soaring over Plato’s tomb.” They listened no longer to tired, wearisome voices from the Cloister and hailed Plato and Plotinus as heavenly messengers. 

Plotinus and the Alexandrian scholars, repelled by Aristotelian formalism, tried to grasp the flow of life, its passion, and the source of its passion through insight rather than discourse. What they achieved, they strove to express in allegory and metaphor; for they felt the impossibility of putting ultimate reality into words.
