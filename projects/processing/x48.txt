4 As pointed out by Bergson, the present is pregnant, as it were, with the past in its momentum. Some scientific men accept Butler's.


And Herings' suggestions and talks about that tradition in terms of “unconscious memory.” Even today, we have not quite set ourselves free from vague “explanations” and metaphors.

But so shrewd a thinker as Bruno must have perceived that if, in some way, individual centers of experience persist in the Soul of the World, they can hardly be said to do so for themselves. If they endure as centers of energy, they do not retain a true memory-synthesis; recurrent habits in life are not equivalent to self-conscious recollection. Individual immortality loses its value if the soul has to pass through the waters of forgetfulness.

But that “to be” is.


“To Experience” was not explicitly recognized by Bruno or anyone before Berkeley wrote it. It is quite possible that he entertained the idea of centers of energy persisting within the Absolute, bearing effects—though not precise memories—of past incarnations. The question of immortal souls will recur in connection with great Latin poems.

The fire and intemperate vigor of his Southern nature made him rejoice in the Bacchic rout of life and nature. He is forever insisting on the universality and value of vicissitude. The Spaccio commences:

“If there were no change in bodies, no variety in matter, and no vicissitude in beings, there would be nothing agreeable, nothing good or anything pleasant. We see that pleasure and satisfaction consist in nothing else but a certain passage, progress, or motion from one state to another.

It is certain that the state of hunger is irksome and unpleasant; and satiety is a state of sadness and dullness: but what is pleasing in any of…“


This text describes how humans derive temporary pleasure from labor and rest, noting that satisfaction from either state is short-lived. It highlights the prevalence of political dissimulation in the 16th century, particularly among ambassadors like Bruno who had ample opportunities to observe it. The text criticizes a custom where rulers are not expected to keep their word, describing how even gods sometimes practice this form of deceit out of prudence.

Giordano Bruno discusses these themes vigorously in his work.


Escape Blame and Outrage.

He thinks hunting game is cruel; a sport worthy only of butchers. The hunting dog should be sent to Corsica or England.

The Cup must be given to the chief tippler in Germany, where gluttony is regarded as heroic virtue and drunkenness as a quality of heaven.

The affected dignity of potentates in their dress and baubles of rank is satirized but with a weaker hand than is usual with our author.

This work, although addressed to Sidney, would seem to have fallen flat like the others published in England. However, in 1633, a masque, based on The "Spaccio," was played before Charles I and Henrietta Maria; the Spaccio may have influenced Spenser in writing The Two Cantos of Mutabilitie.

Interest in Bruno was manifested by a little group of English deists at the beginning of the eighteenth century. One of these, supposed to be W. Morehead, translated the Dialogues but not the Dedicatory Letter of the Spaccio. This translation closely follows the original, rendering its involved style and redundant language so exactly that I have availed myself of it in the:
