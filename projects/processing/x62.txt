### Biography

16 GIORDANO BRUO

Giordano Bruno's interest lay in the operations of the mind in mathematics and subtle natural sympathies—topics that captivated his era, which was open to nearly any belief. For Bruno, magic represented natural processes that were obscure and astonishing, though he believed these could eventually be understood through their true character and laws.

His mnemonic system was considered a form of occult science. Beyond the realm of Black Magic, magical sciences were acknowledged as disciplines concerned with mathematics, physical sympathies, obscure causes and effects, divine subjects like inspiration and prophecy, judicial astrology, metaphysical speculation, etc.

Bruno had already shown interest in areas deemed perilous by the Church—a borderland between lawful and unlawful practices. In England, he wrote about extraordinary effects wrought through such means.


By the One Spirit in all things.

1. He dedicated his De Magia to a pupil named Besler, a youth from Nuremberg, whose father had studied under Luther and whose brother gained distinction as a botanist. Besler continued to act as Bruno’s copyist and either accompanied or followed him to Padua.

2. In 1866, the manuscripts of nine treatises and a larger work of Bruno's were put on the market in Paris and are now in the Moscow Library. These, known as the Noroff MSS., are for the most part in Besler’s hand; however, some parts were written by Bruno himself. A copy of the De Magia is at Moscow, dated 1590, and a later manuscript by the same copyist is preserved in the Augustan Library at Erlangen, together with the two codices of “Aristotle.”


Physics expounded by the illustrious Giordano Bruno of Nola. All these documents include one from the same hand.

**De Magia Concerning Magic**

This text treats mathematics as hidden or occult operations found both in mind and nature. Action and reaction at a distance are explained using Neo-Platonic principles of universal animism and mutual influences. Many marvelous phenomena, considered miraculous, are accepted as due to natural operations whose precise nature remains undiscovered.

Everything may be reduced to the antagonistic yet cooperative principles of love and hate, or attraction and repulsion. There is one Soul of the World, of which finite souls are passing phases, and all things are derived from the Divine but exist in successively decreasing degrees of reality and truth.

There are also manuscript excerpts from Agrippa and other authors with annotations by Bruno; all belong to this period.

**“The Principles, Elements, and Causes of Things,” dated March 16th, 1590,** is a work showing great respect for and acceptance of tradition. The magician is said to operate with his soul, and belief helps the effect; wherefore the Son of God could not work miracles where there was incredulity.

Dulity.

1. Light is a spiritual substance which exists in all things.
2. Air, the principle which causes movement, is within the body of the world.
3. He expresses belief in planetary influences. He intended to study judicial astrology; but he had little respect for the usual pretenders to that science and had nothing but contempt for conjuration, incantation, etc.

4. The importance of this work lies in its full consideration.

5. It is worthy of note that, while Bruno placed little value on the testimony of miracles, he accepted those of Christ without question, as well as His birth from a Virgin-mother. See documents xi-xii.
