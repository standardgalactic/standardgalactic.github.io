The Roman form of the Tribunal was not allowed in Venice; he felt secure there and, when dragged before the Venetian Court, he was confident, fearless, and franker than was customary even for innocent persons. Untaught by so long and bitter experience, he believed that such highly qualified scholars and thinkers as the men who tried him would be as devoted to the pursuit of truth as himself—eager for “large draughts of intellectual day,” tolerant and broad-minded, and as ready to follow the Divine Counsellor within them.

He remembered only the long periods of intelligent toleration by which the Church had distinguished itself and forgot the Council of Trent. He boldly expounded his philosophy.


And science—he might be mistaken on this or that point—but he believed he presented what intelligent men would discover to be truth, or at least a reasonable view of God and nature. So, the first man since the triumph of Christianity to return openly to the independence of the old Greek thinkers, he claimed the right to expound philosophy as essentially superior to theology and independent of it. He maintained his right to think for himself; he would not passively receive the opinions of others. He referred his judges to his latest works. He was anxious to subscribe, though very necessary and of supreme practical importance.

His temperament was scientific, not pietistic.  
- Giordano Bruno


Though extremely reverent, he avoided all fanatic ways. Like many men of the Renaissance, he found traces of truth in every singular creed. Ancient cults held a certain charm for Bruno; the religion of the classical world was tolerant, glorified humanity, and rejoiced in the fullness of life. The Bacchic revelry of its deities illustrated the persistent power and vital immanence of the Godhead. The ancient Egyptians also saw God in nature.

Christianity seemed inferior in that it had become a cult focused on ascetic saints and relics; it mutilated human joy and noble activities, becoming obscurantist. The Pope had pushed his pretensions unduly. Yet, the emphasis Christianity laid on divine love raised it above other imperfect shadows of the One Perfect Light. Only through purging superstition and granting complete tolerance could its full potential be realized.


To the qualified and judicious thinker were needed. The opposition between Revelation and reason had been clearly discerned at a very early period in the history of the Church. Tertullian affirmed the former to be “credible because inconsistent; assured because impossible.” Later, in order to secure freedom for human reason, certain schoolmen maintained that Truth is twofold and contrary, with the content of reason occupying a different sphere from that of Faith. They enabled the human intellect to pursue its own course but acknowledged the distinct and superior claim of Faith because of its absence of reason.

BRUNO AND THE INQUISITORS  
285 acknowledged. The doctrine had not yet been impugned, and Bruno frequently distinguished between Catholic and philosophical doctrines in his defense. However, he did not accept it though he did not disclaim it. Of the line of Lully and Cusanus, he took a higher ground. Lully maintained the possibility of demonstrating Catholic truth by the exercise of reason; Cusanus had made some attempt to explain away current theology. Bruno scorned theological subtleties and disputes.


1. His conviction was that dogma was merely a symbol of reason, and that intuition and reason, so far from being opposed, are the two sides of what should be the great and growing body of organized knowledge.

As early as the second century, certain followers of Aristotle began to interpret the Hebrew Scriptures in terms of Greek philosophy. Later, Philo systematized allegorical renderings of them. Tertullian, Augustine, and the early Christian apologists availed themselves of the doctrine of "language of accommodation." 

2. St. Thomas Aquinas, whom Bruno especially respected, expounded and Dante popularized the doctrine that both Scripture and Holy Church condescend to the weakness of human faculty.

3. The best minds in the Middle Ages took the symbolic view that the world was subtly and mystically interpenetrated by the Divine Spirit, which revealed itself in many imperfect forms. They regarded Virgil as inspired in the same way as Isaiah, though less fully and persistently. Classic mythology was symbolic to Dante and others; an uncertain twilight penetrated by flashes from the high white star of truth. This belief Bruno accepted. Authority still reigned in the Re...

naissance, and Bruno defended himself by quoting Virgil.


The text discusses how philosophy was not intended for the general populace at the time: “Let simplicity and moral fable remain.” This perspective is illustrated by Bruno, who, though innovative in thought, took care to align himself with traditional doctrines. He endeavored to maintain peace with the Inquisition, carefully avoiding explicit explanations of his interpretations of heaven, purgatory, and hell, as hinted at in the Spaccio.

Roman Christianity served as an organized bond uniting Western peoples, especially for those like Bruno who were born and raised within the Catholic Faith. This system was deeply ingrained in individuals from a young age, becoming integral to their identity and belief structure.


Corporate communion, which he had been part of for years, made him doubly an exile from home. Catholic authority judged him guilty of sin, and as a good member of human society and a devout Catholic, he accepted the judgment, however mistaken it might be. While he would not sacrifice any assured philosophical convictions, he was in deadly peril; his chance of being received into the bosom of the Church had now narrowed down to what might happen at this trial. Surely, at worst, he might hope for life and be allowed a life of quiet study if he did what he had always purposed doing—confess his fault.

He fell on his knees and submitted but did not retract. Seven years before, he had written: "As to my faith, I hold it most proper to declare and affirm with theologians" (Spaccio, III).


fered a letter from Rome, dated September 12th. Perhaps religious zeal alone did not prompt this action. Rome always seized political opportunities to assert Papal claims over governments that often defied them and with whom there was an enduring territorial dispute.

Five days later, on September 17th, the letter was read at a sitting of the Venetian Inquisition, with Tommaso Morosini present as the State Assessor. The Sacred Tribunal needed to act cautiously; they waited until the next Roman post arrived so that it was not until eleven days later that the Vicar of the Venetian Patriarch, the Father Inquisitor, and Morosini appeared before the Doge and Council.
