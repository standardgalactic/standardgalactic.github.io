Searching questions would seem to have been put to the Denouncer, as another statement dated May 2nd runs: On the day when I held Bruno locked up, I asked him if he would fulfill his promises concerning what he proved unwilling to teach me in return for my many acts of kindness and gifts, so that I might not accuse him of saying so many wicked words against our Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Catholic Church.


“Truly an astounding piece of self-revelation! The short-witted man discloses not only avarice but also the hypocrisy of his religious zeal in weighing his coppers against his Christianity. The precious document continues:

“He replied that he had no dread of the Inquisition, for he had offended no one in his way of living and could not recall having said anything wicked; and even if he had done so, he had said it to me without any witness being present, and therefore he did not fear that I could injure him in that way. Even if he should be handed over to the Inquisition, they could only force him to resume his habit.

‘So you were a monk,’ I said.

He replied, ‘I only took the vows.’” 

Compare Cotin’s statement, page 35.

First habit, and therefore, in any case, I can readily adjust this dramatic account of how Bruno let slip that he had been a monk, how Mocenigo caught at it, and how Bruno lied concerning the final and irrevocable vow hardly tallies with Bruno’s own account. Bruno said he had consulted his host as well as many priests about getting to the Apostolic Chair and being allowed to live in peace, wearing the clerical habit but not under monastic rule.

I followed up with: "And how can you adjust your affairs if you do not believe in the most Holy Trinity; if you say such wicked things of our Lord Jesus Christ; if you"


Hold our souls to be made of filth and everything in the world to be guided by Fate, as you have told me on several occasions. You must first adjust your opinions, and the rest will be easy; and if you wish, I will give you all the aid I can so that you may know that, although you have broken your word and been ungrateful for my kindness, I still wish in every way to be your friend.

At this, he only prayed me to set him free. If he had packed his things and told me he wished to leave, he did not mean it; instead, he wanted to bridle my impatience to be taught, wherein I perpetually tormented him. He said that if I would set him at liberty, he would teach me all he knew; moreover, he would disclose the secret of all his works to me alone. Also, he meditated writing others, which should be beautiful and exceptional. He would be my slave with no further reward than what I had already given. If I wanted everything he had in my house,


It should be mine, for in every way he owed everything to me: all he wanted was a little book of conjurations which I found among his writings.

This was “The Seals of Hermes and Ptolemy,” which Albertus Magnus, universal doctor of the Church, speaks about and which Besler copied at Padua for Bruno, who had not yet read it.

**THE TRIAL**

The evil lead given in the fourth century by the fifteen ineffective edicts against heresy in order to weld the Empire into unity and protect it against those blind, scarcely conscious centrifugal forces which were apt to fight under the more legible ensigns of religious differences persisted throughout the Middle Ages. But it was not until the Thirteenth Century that an organized Inquisition was first established.


Instituted by the Church, holding the keys of heaven and hell at its girdle and conscious of the duty to maintain its own supremacy and some sort of unity in Europe, acted with free authority and made a systematic attempt to fetter opinion. Its proceedings became secret and mysterious; the victim disappeared as if the earth had silently swallowed him, and the issue was only apparent when he was restored to public gaze in a procession of priests and godly men conducting him to the stake. Written accusations were accepted from anyone, and while the accused might demand a written account of the charges brought against them, the names of the accuser and witnesses were withheld.

After a period of greater tolerance, at the instigation of Don Íñigo López de Recalde, better known as Ignatius Loyola, founder of the order of Jesuits and a man wholly devoted to the service of God, Paul III yielded to the entreaties of Cardinal Carafa and instituted the Roman Inquisition on July 21, 1542. This was done on an improved, severe basis.

It is believed that, at that time,  
the Inquisitors met at the  
Patriarchal Palace on the opposite side of the Rio di Palazzo  
to the prison and a little higher up. They sat under the  
presidency of the Patriarch.
