**THE ASSUMED NAME SUDDENLY**

In the next work, so full of those English experiences with which we have already dealt, Bruno for the first time gave his great original genius free scope in a novel direction. At a time when the old Greek questioning of experience had been well-nigh abandoned for centuries, and before the advent of methods of induction, he provided, to borrow Bacon's phrase, "anticipations of Nature" rather than reasoned interpretations.

These were brilliant, albeit somewhat rash, and have usually turned out to be true. He perceived that to get at truth, one must extract it from Nature, wherein it lies imbedded like her own gold. Nature is the solid ground on which to build forever. He was among the first to break away from the worship of antiquity and the retention of time-mouldered opinion, thereby opening a new era.

The “Cena De Le Ceneri” (The Ash-Wednesday Supper) contains five brisk and entertaining dialogues between four interlocutors. Teofilo, who is Bruno under another name, recounts those famous episodes we know of and defends the Nolan's views to Bruno’s friend Smith, Trulla, and Prudenzio, with the latter being a representative of established authority.


Narrow-minded, ignorant, and obstructive pedantry in general, and in particular, those Peripatetics who "get heated over what they don’t understand—not even the titles of Aristotle's books." As we know, the talk is enlivened with caustic observations on the Aristotelians and social England, for these animals have no such tender skins that they would mind a trifle of blows yet heavier. Bacon; *Nov. Org.*, xxvi. Cen.; Di al. I.

Patrician and scholarly prejudice against the common herd—those souls of geese that bear the shape of men. Bruno took the opportunity of being among Italianised Englishmen to write in his own tongue; in this, as in much else, he was a pioneer. He was one of the first to treat of such high matters as philosophy and science in a modern language. The dignified and once conventional habit of addressing the cultured classes in Latin was not entirely abandoned until two centuries later.

He will give full expression in his native Neapolitan to his fulness of thought and feeling. His style, he determines, shall imitate the painter who does not content himself with depicting his main subject but, in order to fill his canvas and make art conformable with nature, puts in rocks, mountains, trees.


Fountains, streams, and hillocks. Here, you may find a royal palace; there, a wood. Here a strip of sky with half of a rising sun, and scattered about, a bird, a pig, a stag, a donkey, a horse. These are merely indicated by head, horn, limb, or ears—perhaps even by ears—but at another spot is the whole shape of a beast; some characteristic movement or expression is given so that one discerns everything with enhanced interest; one criticizes and finally centers one’s attention on the main subject.

Again, he tells us he will achieve “a full and mighty prose, taking its own time; coming not as of clerkly art but flowing and strong as are the waters of a mighty current.”


With what success does he pursue this aim? He records:

To move to its own proper place; hence there can be only one world. Like Plato, Aristotle conceived of the stars as being souls akin to a god-like nature—the causes of physical change! Such was the accepted faith. Bruno conceived it to be his mission to destroy every article of it which pertained to physical theory. He carried it on with zeal. Not of him, as of Aristotle, can it be said that he was moderate to excess.

In the "Supper," Bruno's bent towards natural science bursts forth with all the sudden vigor of an Italian spring.


Henceforward, the secrets of nature claimed the greater part of his attention. He did not accept the Copernican theory in his youth; but when he became convinced of its truth, he was the first to see beyond it. Liberated from the fetters of the past by the genius of one solitary thinker, he sent a searchlight through the heavens and applied Copernicus’ theory to the fixed stars.

If nature repeats her operations in planets all of which revolve around the sun, each showing but a variation of one single plan, shall she cease to repeat herself through an unending universe of stars and planets? The universe is all of a piece; the principles which obtain on earth are observed throughout space. Here lies his indisputable merit. He was the first to extend the Copernican theory to all the hosts of heaven. He did so with characteristic boldness. It was a marvelous sweep of scientific imagination, for we must remember that Galileo and Newton had not yet come to supply their confirmatory evidence.

He went further: he was soon to declare that the physical universe occupies infinity—a magnificent concept which the hardihood of today's science would perhaps hesitate to affirm.
