A point from which to observe this cannot have its movement measured.

The mysticism of his countryman Eckhart reappeared in Cusanus and reinforced Bruno's own mystical tendency.

**V. COPERNICUS AND LATER THINKERS**

Not a century after Cusanus, in 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus (1473—1543) expounded the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. However, he did not extend his conclusions, which were drawn from mathematical considerations, to the sidereal heavens. Bruno got hold of Copernicus's work.


2. Probably it was in the monastic library;  
for it had been dedicated to Paul III at the entreaty of friends who feared what might otherwise follow, and one Oslander, a priest of Nuremberg, wrote a preface, in which he protests that the work is not presented as truth but because it furnishes improved practical utility for astronomical computation.

3. Bruno knew that this mendacious apology for speaking the truth was not written by Copernicus, who had asserted his right to deal with the problem in his own way.

4. The thoughtful pondered over Copernicus’ book, perceiving that he had applied Ockham’s razor and dealt a blow to the bad method of multiplying hypotheses to explain observed facts of the same kind. It was irrational to suppose that Nature does not proceed straight to…


The new theory administered a shock to the fashionable Aristotelian physics and cosmogony, which was built on sense perceptions. Over time, it came to be heartily accepted and extended by Bruno, who had early begun to doubt the deliverances of sensation. 

There was general resistance to this new view. Those with the spirit of the Renaissance felt that a blow was struck at their exaltation of humanity; the pious opined that the fall of the official science of the Church might bring down much more.

For Bruno, the vivid and realistic pictures of Dante were replaced by another kind of realism—colder perhaps—but only equally compelling.

32 GIORDANO BRUNO


Colder to the unimaginative, appealing less, perhaps,  
to ordinary human sympathy, but far more powerfully to intellectual vision. He was prepared to trust Reason and follow her whithersoever she might lead, and he saw that if the importance of man as a being was diminished, his intellect, which could hold the whole solar system in its grasp, gained infinitely in dignity.

Bruno read “The Nature of Things” by Bernardino Telesio (1509). Local patriotism would prepare him to appreciate the writings of a man who, born at Cosenza, had founded the Cosentina Academy at Naples. Telesio insisted on the importance of observation and took for his motto, "not by reason, but by sense." But he admitted that the mind co-operates with sensation.


1 Bruno calls him "the most judicious Telesio."

2 Girolamo Cardano (1501–1556) was another writer whom Bruno valued for his appreciation of physical enquiry. He used much superstitious information which can be traced to Cardano, or to the writings of that half-mad genius in motley, Aureolus Theophrastus Paracelsus (1493–1541). Paracelsus attracted Bruno because of his attempt to determine the chemical constitution of things; he held all creatures to be emanations from a world-soul and taught a doctrine deduced from this—that throughout the whole choir.

**DISCIPLINE OF BOOKS 33**

Of heaven and furniture of earth there exists a subtle sympathy. Although Pietro Aretino Manzoli (Palin Genius) held the universe to be infinite, he did not produce much effect on Bruno. Indeed, it seems doubtful whether Bruno ever read this Ferrarese poet, for he speaks of him as being German.

Bruno was vastly interested in the mathematics of his day and later gave the subject much thought, evincing considerable originality, sometimes of a mistaken kind. Like Bacon, he had taken all knowledge to be his province. Most of his acquisitions must have been made during the quiet years at Naples. Henceforth, he was a wanderer, earning his bread; and what small leisure befell him.


He was given up to creative work.
