**WANDERINGS THROUGH ITALY: FROM NAPLES TO GENEVA (1576–1579)**

It was a common thing in those days for monks to wander from district to district and even from country to country. By this means, the individual monk was enabled to see men and cities and enlarge his mind, while at the same time he gained new experiences and perspectives.


Got exercise and improved his health; the monastic community, too, benefited by the interchange of ideas and was enlivened by news from the outer world. The doors of a monastery were always kept wide open to a wandering brother of the order, so Bruno, escaped from Naples, would find no difficulty in obtaining hospitality. He boldly claimed it at the actual headquarters of his order. The church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva stands on the site of a ruined temple, opposite another which has only been robbed of its gilded tiles and its gods: it and its famous monastery confront the yet more famous temple of Agrippa.

He was not left there long in peace. “I learned,” he says, “that after I left Naples, certain works of St. Chrysostom and St. Jerome containing the forbidden annotations of Erasmus, which I had secretly used and thrown into the privy when I came away to prevent their being found, were discovered.” Erasmus had…


“Laid the egg of the Reformation in 1527, Edward Lee, afterwards Archbishop of York, extracted twenty-one heretical opinions from his writings (Doc. my: 34-36). Giordano Bruno was concerned in some “taking off” so common in Italy, especially in Southern Italy, during those days. But if so, how did it affect Giordano? Was it connected with the citation for heresy? Was there danger of vendetta? Was there influence at work, or something connected with the case that would fatally weigh on the minds of Bruno’s superiors? It is an inviting puzzle; however, the data are imperfect. Ingenious and plausible hypotheses are nearly always exploded upon the discovery of fresh facts. He contrived to get away from the gathering storm.”


He cast aside his monkish garb, resumed his baptismal name of Philip, and was no longer known as Jordanus while he remained in Italy. He traveled over the three hundred miles or more that lay between Rome and the Republic of Genoa, where bloody faction fights and the long struggle of various classes for mastery still prevailed. The Genoese, whom Dante denounced as barbarians, were ever more famous for their quarrels and commercial enterprise than for their encouragement of learning, providing little inducement for a scholar to remain in that unquiet city. He observed one thing with scornful amusement: it struck him so much that he refers to it twice.

“At Genoa I saw the monks of [S. Maria di] Costello exhibit a tail with a veil over it, and making folk kiss it, saying, 'Don’t touch: kiss this is the holy relic of that blessed ass which was made worthy to bear our God.'”


From Mount Olivet to Jerusalem. Worship it, kiss it—and give alms. You shall receive an hundredfold and inherit eternal life.

Bruno must have been accustomed to miracles in Naples such as the liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius, which still continues to take place four times a year. We shall find him ready to accept strange things as due to natural causes not yet explained. But this base, mercenary fraud was too much for his credulity; it symbolized the asceticism he despised.

On the Riviera Ponente, between thirty and forty miles from Genoa, lies Noli. It is a quaint, ancient little coastal town at the head of a rocky gulf, surrounded by vineyards and backed by picturesque mountains which almost encircle it and are close beyond its high walls. At that time, it was a prosperous little place, governing itself under the protection of the Genoese Republic.

“Here,” says Bruno, “I supported myself during four or five months by teaching grammar to children and the sphere to certain men of condition.” The subject of Astronomy was then called “The Sphere,” because the earth was supposed to be the central kernel of a series of transparent spheres enclosing the sun, moon, planets, and fixed stars—spheres for the metaphysical reason that the circle is considered the perfect figure.


These spheres were supposed to revolve around the Earth with uniform motion because that is considered the most perfect rate of velocity. Questions such as the exact situation of heaven and the precise nature of divine ideas embodied in the skies were included in teaching “The Sphere.” It was a popular subject for writing about and lecturing on, and ladies as well as men read papers on it at literary clubs—the Italian "Academies." Probably Bruno taught these gentlemen of distinction more concerning “The Sphere” than was expected from him. For reasons which he does not give, he turned back a few miles to Savona, the former rival of Genoa, and even then, a busy port. It probably provided Bruno with little more than pleasant prospects amid gardens of orange trees.

There are lemon trees; for, at the end of fifteen days, he made his way to Turin, the capital of Piedmont.

1 There is a curious story that a fourth process against the fugitive monk was issued at Vercelli by the Genoese Republic. The statement is far from inconceivable, but it comes from a suspected source; it is said to have been derived from the sentence of the Inquisition, a document which was non-producible at the time the assertion was made.

3 Turin was then under Filiberto Emmanuele, one of the most enlightened monarchs of a line that, during ten centuries, has proved itself the astutest of the ruling houses of Europe. The reigning duke fostered both science and literature and, a few years before, had reconstituted the University, making it one of the first in Italy. No town in Europe is built on such a regular plan as Turin; Bruno found it a city of delight.


‘But, getting no satisfactory sustenance there, I came down to Venice, where I stayed a month and a half in Frezzeria—the lane of shops at the end of the great Piazza, opposite St Mark's. To the eye, all was bright; the carvings on the splendid palaces gave evidence of the taste, wealth, and pride of Venice. Every uncarved wall was resplendent with the noble designs of some great master, wet and new, or at least still unflaked and unfaded, and the canals below reflected their gorgeous hues. But Venice was in a terrible state within. For two long years, plague had devastated the city, carrying off people, including the aged Titian among them. Venice offered a fairly safe asylum from the Inquisition; however, how should Bruno live there?’ (Doc. ix.)

5. Doc. IX. WANDERINGS THROUGH ITALY 39: In a succinct account of his days given to the inquisitors, we read: "Whilst there, in order to furnish myself with a few pieces to live on, I got a book printed entitled 'The Signs of the Times.' But I showed it first to the Revd. Father Master Remigio of Florence, a monk of Bruno's own order, who had gained distinction because of his learning."


and his version of the Psalms.

Probably Bruno now made up his mind to try for better fortune in France, where Italians were well received and Italian influence was paramount. He continues: "Leaving Venice, I went on to Padua, where I found some Dominican fathers of my acquaintance. They persuaded me to wear my habit again, showing me that it was more convenient to travel with than without it. With this idea in my mind, I went to Bergamo and had a robe made of cheap white cloth, and over this I wore the scapular which I kept with me when I left Rome."
