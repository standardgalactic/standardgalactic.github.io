As he regards it physically, his conception of this enigmatic substance closely resembles that which was accepted in the latter half of the last century. But he may have supposed it to be a sort of sublimated, spiritual body of the Soul of the World.

It was Bruno’s habit to employ a pupil as copyist. In the Augustan Library at Erlangen there exist two codices of Aristotle’s Physics explained. One of these is in an unknown handwriting; the other was written later by Besler, of whom more anon. This work, with all other manuscript treatises by Bruno, has been published recently at the charge of the Italian people.

Vitelli thinks it is the substance of lectures given at Wittenberg, but Stolzle and Tocco believe it to belong to the period when he lectured at Paris. Bruno introduces a good deal of his own teaching into this tractate, which deals with Aristotle’s...


**Physics, Generation and Corruption, and a part of his Meteorology.**

He also dictated a more important work at Wittenberg, “The Lamp of Thirty States.” There are both earlier and later copies at Erlangen, with the latter being less correct and done by Besler in Padua.

This work is referred to in a publication from Prague in 15885 as the *Lampas Caballistica*, or "The Cabalistic Lamp," described as “a work to appear shortly.” However, it has only been printed recently. It is a logical and mnemonic work somewhat on Lullian lines and not barren of Neo-Platonic speculation. It was intended to provide an instrument for the discovery of truth.


The arrangement and much of the thought in it appear mechanical and artificial to the modern reader, but its fantastic types, images, etc., were calculated to popularize it at the time. The author avails himself of Aristotelian conceptions; however, it is obvious that he is a later interpreter.

- It remains one.
1. Still farther on, we read that the individual is a spark of the Universal Spirit, from which he issues and to which he returns.
2. But while God, as absolute, works in and through us, He does not impart Himself to us in His most innermost nature.
3. Intellect is not merely a function of animal organs.
4. Incidentally, will is treated of. There are grades of volition; material, composite, and spiritual varieties may be distinguished.
