Bruno typically employs the earlier notion of substance—the “I know not what” of Locke—which gives unity. We allow substantive value to both brute matter and spirit. Let us consider the material substrate, that invisible...


Something which gives one essence to all visible forms exists not merely in actual being but also as the possibility of being. All that is possible and all that is actual must be referred to a principle which is both possibility and substance. Everything that exists is possible, but power or potency has caused it to be. So matter is more than an existing substrate; it is potentiality, possibility, and actuality in undistinguished unity.

Aristotle held the infinite to be potential only, not actual. Now, in what relation does the substrate of brute matter stand to Spirit or Form in general? The spiritual and material worlds can be distinguished, but there can be no distinction without an underlying identity; so we are...

2 GIORDANO BRUNO

Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists, while apprehending the one-ness of the Universe, had divorced unity from reality and unwarrantably asserted the independent being of a mere abstraction. Bruno advanced far beyond this; nor, although Schelling found in the Nolan's thought a kinship with his own, was Bruno's Absolute a mere "blank featureless Identity." 

"We rejoice," he writes.


"In the unity of the sensible (in unum sensibile) but most of all in that which comprehends all sensibility in one knowledge, which embraces all cognitions; in one power of apprehension which includes all that can possibly be apprehended; in one being that completes everything—most of all, in the unity which is the whole itself.

It is absolute simplicity—not because it is abstract or devoid of differences within its essence, but because all divisions are healed in the single comprehensive, harmonious intuition which is God. In other words, Bruno arrives at One Reality, which moves and knows itself through its many aspects and is that Whole in and through which the manifold exists. All things in process are nothing apart from the Whole."


"The highest good, the highest perfection, the highest blessedness consists in the unity which enmeshes all."

Bruno's thought reappears in Spinoza, whom he directly influenced; but Bruno's speculations are less rigid, statical, and systematic than Spinoza's. Bruno never loses his hold on the notion of Living Spirit. He stands by his master, Cusanus; philosophy points for both thinkers to the union of all distinctions and contraries in that which is one.

Both men were on the road towards the Metaphysic of a great English thinker of our own day: they had the root-idea of an all-including Absolute, wherein are all centres of experience and all differences.


Eternity exists as such, but not merely as such: in and for the whole, they are also transmuted and harmonized. Whatever else the Absolute may be, we know that, as transcendent, it unites all contraries in one perfect cognition; as immanent, it is the Universal Soul, unfolding the eternal meaning, infinite and without beginning or end.

Living out our share of the divine meaning and being actually one with the Infinite and Eternal, we need not fear death. Bruno flatters himself that he has “taken away the dread of Orcus and greedy Charon, which spoils the sweetness of life.” Such are the conclusions of Reason, let Theology say what it will. But discreet theologians will always admit natural reasoning, whithersoever it may lead, provided it does not dispute divine authority but submits to it.

Indeed,


From the early days when Scotus Erigena wrote, there had been thinkers who had no desire to oppose dogma if they were permitted to interpret it by their own metaphysical conclusions. Nor had the Church thought it wise to interfere with them seriously. As has been said, from the less courageous days of William of Ockham and Duns Scotus, philosophy had evaded the interference of the Church and secured some independence in philosophical thinking through a clever tactic. Truth was held to be of two kinds: philosophic and theological, which might be in opposition to one another. Bruno belonged to the bolder line of Erigena.
