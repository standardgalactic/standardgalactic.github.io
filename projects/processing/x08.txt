2 Finno and his fellows translated Plato and the Neo-Platonists, and Bruno read these translations as well as the Platonic writings of the translators. We know from his character and from his Neo-Platonic works how he must have lived in his own enthusiasm and found spiritual nourishment in thoughts too vital not merely to be put by the syllogistic method of the schoolmen, but even to be quite definitely expressed.

A modern writer has justly observed that Plotinus is the greatest individual thinker between Aristotle and Descartes. Much in Neo-Platonism fascinated Bruno, especially from works like *Eroici Furori*, as well as *De Umbris Idearum* and *Sigillus Sigillorum*.

The conception of the universe as a process of production from One who suffers no loss thereby, and Plotinus’ explanation of the lower by the higher, became an integral part of much Alexandrian thinking. This was often transmuted and improved in his own philosophy.

St. Clement had declared that we cannot discern what God is so much as what He is not. Cusanus taught the same thing, and Bruno accepted the final limitation of human reason and experience, along with Plotinus’ doctrine of a being above discursive thought, above good and evil, beauty, and the distinctions within the Will—of power, freedom, and necessity. For our thought, being discursive, is imperfect.

The Absolute produces Mind contemplating itself; that is, it is self-conscious; and from Mind…


Proceeds the Soul of the World. This is the trinity of being, and The One participates in all souls, separate in space and time, yet present to one another in the Soul of the Whole.

5 The Soul of the World is not in time, but, just as light (which in Plotinus' and also in Bruno's time was supposed to suffer no loss in transmission) passes by gradations into darkness, so does the Ineffable pass, without loss, through gradations of being. And, even as privation of light...

24 GIORDANO BRUNO  
Is darkness, so is the privation of God evil.


1. Though even in evil there is a rational order which issues in good.

2. Although individual souls are comprised and co-present to one another in the Soul of the World, they are separate in lower spheres. Having descended from the Absolute, they ever tend to return to Him "who is at once thine innermost self and thine unattainable desire."

3. Plotinus further perceived that life is no mere collection of particles; he makes the unextended individual soul form its own body. It dwells wholly in every part which it animates, for can a part act vitally when separated from the whole to which it belongs!

4. The individual soul is the cause of its own thought and action but is determined in its context.

5. The universe and its souls are in activity without beginning or end; all things being traces or shadows, in vastly differing measures, of the Supernal.


Bruno maintained this doctrine of shades and vestiges throughout his life. Like Plotinus, Bruno accepted universal animism; indeed, every thinker of his own time did so as well. In fact, the view dated back to Thales.

“The common mark of all Alexandrian philosophy is that it regards divine revelation as the highest source of knowledge.”

Porphyry tells us that Plotinus was rapt into ecstatic vision of the Absolute four times and was united with Him; Porphyry himself had a similar experience (1 Enn., 7.1, 6; I, 7, 9). - Bruno, *De Umbra*, Introd. IV.
