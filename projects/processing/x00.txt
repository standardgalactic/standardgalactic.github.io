**PREFACE**

The life of Bruno has been written in English more than once, and he has had many excellent commentators. NO


One can now write about him without relying heavily on "the solid and scholarly work done by Tocco, Florence, Berti, Brunner, McIntyre, and others. The apology for the appearance of this present work is that some facts, unrecorded in England, have come to light in recent years, and also that a few usual but almost unavoidable inaccuracies require correction. Moreover, I have tried to follow the development of Bruno's thoughts in the order in which he declared them; and on one or two points, I find myself compelled to differ from the conclusions of this or that commentator.

Most of Bruno's works have been published in the editions by Wagner, Lagarde, and Gfrörer, well edited for their day.


Different libraries contain different editions, and not all are to be found in any one place. Even the British Museum, although it possesses a fine collection of rare, original impressions, does not contain all the volumes of the complete State Edition and lacks that one which contains works discovered in manuscript. Giving the paging of a particular edition might therefore prove less convenient than the plan I have adopted of giving those indications for reference which are supplied by the subdivisions of the works themselves, except in the case of the published manuscripts.

**GIORDANO BRUO**

Those who wish to verify a reference will thereby readily do so and may discover that reading the context is not a wholly unprofitable task. I have given minuter detail as to other works from which I have drawn or which throw light on the subject-matter.
