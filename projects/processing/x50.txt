Which holds the first rank: a man who has become a donkey or a donkey transformed into a man?

Six years later, Bruno informed his readers that he had suppressed the Ass of Cyllene because it annoyed the vulgar and did not please the Wise on account of its sinister flavour.

Probably the Cabala was withdrawn as well.


Supplement VI

**The Transports of Intrepid Souls**

The full significance and subtle associations of the title "Gli Eroi c'Fuor di Sè" cannot be adequately rendered. Plato discovered in the passion of Greek friendship an imperfect image of divine, ideal beauty and goodness, and taught that it may be converted into a spur to our highest desire. Through the Alexandrian thinkers, who mingled Platonic doctrines with Oriental mysticism, this thought reached the Middle Ages. United with the Provençal sentiment of chivalrous devotion to a chosen lady, it influenced Dante and transfigured love occupied the great poet in his two most important works.

Taking a more fleshly form, ...

Petrarch's sentiment found a lower level and by the sixteenth century it had furnished a vast crowd of poetasters and dilettanti with fashionable affectations. Yet, in the fifteenth century, Benivieni, Pico, and others, and at the beginning of the sixteenth, Castiglioni soared almost as high as Plato on wings hardly less confident.

However, the usual Petrarchistic sonneteer,


Forced, artificial, and absurd was as hateful to Bruno as the pedant and not less foolishly dull. He makes Tansillo, the Petrarchist, his chief interlocutor, point out a new and sure way: The intellectual lover may, by strenuous effort, reach a comprehensive vision of Nature, which is the very image, nay the presence of God, though he may not reach that sense of direct union, which is pure feeling, granted to Plotinus and other mystics. The work is one long hymn to intellectual beauty, in prose and verse. One feels the influence of the *Timaeus* and the vision of the Platonic soul moving about the same in unchanging thought of the same. Bruno tells us that he followed lines laid down in the *Symposium* and *Phaedrus*.


In the introductory letter to Sidney, when writing concerning the constant transformation of all things, he digresses to distinguish between those who declare according to reason and their own light and those who declare by faith and a higher light. “He follows with a frank word as to his own attitude towards current Christian doctrine.” As to my faith, “he says, I hold it a most proper thing to declare and affirm with theologians and those who are concerned with the laws and institutions of the people in their interpretation: just as I am not slack to affirm and accept the sense of those among the good and wise who speak according to reason.

174 GIORDANO BRUNO


That is to say, the religion of a people, being part of its political constitution and laws, must be followed; but the competent may subject it to judicious criticism. This is an important passage because, when tried by the Inquisition, we find Bruno willing to accept the Church as a practical institution and affirm its dogmas as adumbrations of truth, but resolutely maintaining the freedom of philosophy to interpret them and to pursue an independent course.

He did not write for the crowd; nor about social ethics. As in "Spaccio," he will redeem the promise...


He made therein;  
3. That work was but an introduction to this. The intellectually disposed will discover no abiding home in the transitory world of sense or in ordinary piety. Only by the exercise of intellect, which is a divine passion, shall they find anchorage for the soul. Such as would purify the will have already possessed the wings and the divine spirit they seek after, and so are at once the lover and the loved; and their love shall enable these undaunted heroes to pass through suffering (which is no other than a golden spur), become spectators of Infinite Power and Act, and be at one, not indeed with the innermost being of God, but with God in the highest manifestations of his mind.
