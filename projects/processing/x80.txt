Fessed that they had not liked to bear the prisoner away to  
Rome without informing the Council first. This was a device to disguise the aggression of Rome: Venetian consent had to be sought for extradition. The true bias of the judges now appears. They urge that Bruno is not merely guilty of heresy, but a leader therein; he had written books in which he praised Elizabeth of England and other heretical princes and contained much that was inimical to religion, even if taken philosophically. He was an apostate monk who had dwelt many years in those heretical parts—Geneva and England—and he had been pursued for heresy before at Naples and Rome. The Vicar added that he desired the matter should not be delayed, as a boat was just about to set off. 

The Doge refused to be hustled: he replied that the matter should receive due consideration! It was not the first time the Venetian government had had difficulties with the zealous Inquisition; when Sixtus V was Inquisitor in the city, they had demanded his recall by Rome.

In the afternoon of the same day, the Father Inquisitor came again and was put off with the statement that seeing 1 Doc. xvi ii.

Ibid., occupied with many grave matters, they had not been able to decide about it.

A few days later, on October 7th, a copy of the Roman demand was sent by the Pope with secret instructions to Donato, Venetian Ambassador. The Three sign themselves +1, -2, and -6. The request could not be complied with; for the demand was an infringement on the authority of the Venetian Inquisition, and if complied with, a very bad precedent would be set. Moreover, it interfered with the liberty of Venetian subjects. The Ambassador is to convey this to the Cardinal with due compliments.

Donato replied on the 10th that he would carry out these commands: should any incredible argument turn up, he would deal with it discreetly. Three months passed, during


Which Bruno lay in his prison cell at Venice, there was diplomatic fencing between the Pope and Ambassador at Rome. On December 22nd, the Nuncio returned to the charge. He appeared before the Venetian College, repeated some of the “heretical charges,” and added another calculated to appeal to commercial instincts: some of Bruno’s books purported falsely to have been printed at Venice. His Holiness desires to have the prisoner in Rome to expedite justice and begs the Doge to extradite him.

The Nuncio was followed by Donato, who had returned to Venice. He recounted his interview with Clement; he had told the Pope that justice was invariably done at the Venetian Inquisition, for the Pope was always represented there by his Nuncio, who could always obtain instructions from Rome and did so in fact. He failed to see any necessity for extradition. Whereat the Pope appeared to be satisfied and never mentioned the subject again. But Severina and Doc. xx.

The Inquisitors were not men to be easily put off. The Nuncio spoke again, urging that the man was no Venetian but a Neapolitan charged long ago at Naples and Rome with the gravest offenses. On previous occasions, more than two dozen cases had been sent on from Venice to the Holy Roman Tribunal, which, the Nuncio reminded the College, was the head one. The man was merely a friar, and therefore the desire of the Pope should not be denied to him; moreover, the culprit was a notorious heresiarch guilty of vile offenses which he (the Nuncio) would not speak about, as only the matter of faith was to the point. Undoubtedly, the Venetian Inquisitor should deal with ordinary cases arising within the Venetian State, but not with this grave case, begun aforetime in Naples and continued in Rome.

The Nuncio was informed that their Lordships would confer, and he was assured that it was desired to give His Holiness every satisfaction possible. The Government was somewhat perplexed. The Papacy had increased its temporal power by consolidating the States under its rule and, at the same time, the carrying out of the Decrees of Trent had added to its spiritual prestige. An open rupture with Rome was very undesirable, but the Venetian Republic must be kept inviolate from the ever-recurring attempts at aggression which marked the policy of the Pope. So the government consulted with the procurator, Federigo Contarini, an ingenious lawyer, to find a way out. He appeared before the College on January 7th, 1593. After recounting facts as to the first processes against Bruno, he added that he escaped to England, where he lived after the custom of that island, and afterwards.

29.2 GIORDANO BRUNO

Later on the same day, it was resolved by the Three to notify the Nuncio and the Venetian Ambassador at Rome that, finding it suitable, especially in such an unusual case as that of an escaped prisoner from the Neapolitan and Roman Inquisitions, to give satisfaction to His Holiness, Bruno shall be delivered over to the Nuncio. On January 9th, a letter signed like the former one in secret code was sent to Paruta, now Ambassador at Rome, instructing him to make capital out of the transaction he is to represent to the Pope that the extradition...


This text is an expression of the filial reverence the Republic bears for His Beatitude, to commiserate with him on his recent illness and express joy at his recovery.

The compliments were returned: on the 16th, Paruta replies that the extradition was news to His Holiness, who expressed himself as highly gratified. Clement diplomatically added that he greatly desired harmony with the Republic and hoped that it would not give him very hard bones to gnaw, lest he should be accused of yielding too much to his great affection. The Nuncio responded with correct expressions of devotion.

So the prisoner was consigned to the Nuncio and forwarded by sea to Ancona, whence he was transported along a fork of the Flaminian Way and that historic and splendid approach to Rome. Released from eight months of captivity in a cell, some gleam of hope may have visited him as he breathed the keen wintry air and saw the evergreen valleys of Central Italy.


The sun played on the waters of the Tiber. There lay before him dismal years to test his sincerity and firmness, culminating in the ironic pageantry of a triumphal parade to the stake.

**Chapter XX: The Roman Prison - Final Scenes**

He was cast into the prison of the Roman Inquisition on February 27th. He lay there for seven long years. For much of this time, there is absolute silence concerning him, and some Italian critics deem the absence of existing documents significant. During the short rule of the Roman Republic in 1849, the Secret Archives of the Vatican were searched backward from February 1600. Time allowed only records up to November 1598 to be examined. Today, we are assured that no further documents exist there.


Bruno would lie unvisited, save by officials of the Inquisition and chosen priests who came to exhort him to repentance with scriptures in hand. Neither books nor writing materials were allowed. Prisoners were often put into irons. If they remained obstinate in heresy, milder measures were sometimes tried, and promises were held out; or, if they were supposed to conceal their views, they were put to the torture. Campanella was tortured twelve times, the twelfth lasting forty hours.
