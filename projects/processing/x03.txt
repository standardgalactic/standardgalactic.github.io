The southern Italian had not lost his intellectual vigor or his readiness to abandon himself to the enjoyment of simple pleasures, as if all creatures were dwelling in the sunrise of eternity. The Nolans were markedly superstitious, even for a credulous age. They beheld spirits in deserted places—by an ancient temple and where the bodies of the plague-stricken had been buried. Poltergeists played tricks on them, and Bruno records how, when a child, he himself beheld spirits on hills where beeches and laurels grew.

The quick eye of the child noted the peculiarities of his neighbors and the small events of his life; and he never forgot them. Years afterwards, when in exile, he introduces the honest, kindly folk of Nola, not without irony, as interlocutors in his dialogues; he delights in recalling many details which he had observed—the produce of his father's garden, the melon plot of Francesco, the smell of burnt hair.


When Vesta, the wife of Alben tio, used curling-tongs and shook her head; he remembers hearing the cuckoo at Antonio Saulino's when his bitch was being pupped. He recalls how a gown was spoiled by Messer Danese, the tailor, and witnessed Paulino, known for blasphemy, stoop to lift a great shovelful of earth that broke the red string holding up his breeches. Character after character and incident after incident crowd in on his memory: he may have had personal experience with the bugs infesting Cos tati nO's wooden bedstead.

1 The lad's eye was alive to beauty too; to the pure sky, tremulous with excess of flight, the mystery of the shadowy hills, the bounty of the corn-laden plain. In exile, he recalls the glory and glamour of the world that were given to his childhood, never weary of thinking of the golden fields of Nola.

2 His birthplace ever remained for him a place blessed by heaven.

3 He ranks the rich Campagna with Araby and the garden of the Hesperides.

Nolan called his philosophy "the Nolan es e." Other insights include:

5. Ambrogio Leone tells of one who, returning home after only two or three days' absence, cast himself on his native soil and kissed it with unspeakable rapture.

The observant child often gazed across at Vesuvius from vine-bearing Cicala, noticing how bare and forbidding it looked. But one day, his father took him there, and he found its slopes covered with luxuriant trees and bountiful vegetation, while Cicala had become dark and dim and distant. Astonished at the strange change, he writes: "I became aware for the first time that sight could deceive."

The seed of doubt was sown; soon, he would ask: What are the grounds of certitude?


Giordano Bruno  
Influences of the genius loci could not fail to affect an impressionable, imaginative child. To every Italian child, the past calls with living voice; antiquity is real—sometimes it lulls to sleep, sometimes it is a rousing force; it is never, as with the Northern child, a dull dream concerning men who were never really alive, whose voices come as the hollow croakings of Shades. Now, Nola was a poor little place but it had been a great and noble city; it was one of.


The most ancient city in Italy was the Urbs of the Etruscans. The citizens boasted loudly of their descent from a Chalcidian colony. Thrice had Hannibal been repulsed from its gates. Nola had been the chosen home of Roman wealth and fashion; even the great Augustus died there.

True, of its massive walls, its twelve gates, and its two amphitheaters, nothing remained. Ancient marbles were built into cottages, pigsties, and vineyard walls. However, a laborer’s spade often opened up some sepulchre crowded with the famous funeral urns of Nola. His plough would reveal long-buried treasures of ancient coin and medallion.

The little Bruno saw many classic customs observed at wedding feasts, popular festivals, and even in religious rites. He would hear of famous citizens, of whom Nolans were very proud, such as Ambrogio Leone, the scholar, and Giovanni da Nola, the sculptor.

People who derived their life-blood from Etruscan and yet more ancient sources—from Greeks, Romans, Teutons, Moors, and Spaniards—were quick, astute, versatile, very human, as volcanic as their soil. They were debased but not so degenerate as they became after three more centuries of misrule.

Such were the influences we know that molded the mind of little Felipe in his earliest and most formative years (Berti, D., *Vita di G. B.*, 1889, cap. L).

**BIRTH AND PARENTAGE—BOYHOOD**

We do not know how he was educated at Nola, but he must have been a promising pupil, for at about the age of eleven, he was sent to Naples to study humane letters, logic, and dialectic.

In other words, Latin language and literature, probably some Greek, philosophy, and modes of effective reasoning and expression. He may have lodged at an uncle's house. One Agostino Bruno was a weaver of velvet in Naples at the time. He attended the public lectures of II Sarnese, probably one Vicenzio Colle OfSarno, who published later on a work called "The Destruction of the Destructions of Baldwin," which, moreover, the destroyer has fulfilled.

"He says, private lessons in logic from Fra Teofilo da Varano, an Augustinian monk, who afterwards lectured on Metaphysics in Rome."
