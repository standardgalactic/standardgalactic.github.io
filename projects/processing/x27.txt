Bruno even tried to make amends. He admitted that she had been "founded on an excellent basis and was marked by such decorum, dignified ceremonies, and many other adjuncts as to place her, in these respects, first in Europe, while in polish and quickness of mind she can hold her own." However, she was Aristotelian to the core. Three generations later, Sir Thomas Browne wrote of the Copernican theory as being still a subject for debate among the learned.

### Chapter IX: In London


Bruno was in a sad plight: stranded in a strange country, unable to speak its language and with a long purse at his girdle. He found a savior in the French Ambassador, Castelnau, who rescued him “from these doctors and from hunger.” Bruno described Castelnau as “a firm and effective defender, a solid, secure, and enduring rock.”

The ambassador himself was in pecuniary straits: his salary was irregularly paid, and he was obliged to borrow money. However, he gave the wandering Italian scholar a home. As Bruno wrote him, “You did not maintain a man in your household of whom you had need, but one who stood in need of you in many ways.”

“I remained in his house as his gentleman merely,” Bruno noted.

Doubtless Castelnau found him of service; Bruno frequently accompanied him to the Court of Elizabeth. The French Ambassador, in want of money, might have been glad of the aid of an unofficial secretary at no great cost.

Michel de Castelnau, Lord of Mauvissière, was sixty...


Three years old, a man of considerable learning and experience in life. He was one of the earliest men north of the Alps to become a "professional diplomatist." He had traveled in Italy and served in campaigns there and elsewhere; he had been ambassador at the Court of Mary Stewart and also in Germany, and had represented France at Elizabeth's court during the past ten years. He had literary tastes and had translated Ramus' book on "the Gauls." His memory was excellent.


In his memoirs, which he wrote for the instruction of his two sons—a searcher after causes, truthful and a man of impartial judgment—he tells us nothing about Bruno. The memoirs end in the year 1574. He seems to have been reticent and firm but too scrupulous to achieve great success in diplomacy. It is a testimony to his high character that while he defended the interests of Mary Stewart, he retained the warm regard of Elizabeth Tudor. His great antagonist was the Spanish Ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza, for whom he was a poor match in guile.

Indeed, Castelnau was a broad-minded and generous gentleman, sincerely religious but so tolerant that he excused Bruno from attending mass and other religious offices held at his house. Nay more, in permitting the dedication to himself of four of Bruno’s works, Castelnau accepted three of the most daring he ever wrote!

Bruno found the embassy a peaceful haven, where, for


More than two years had passed since he was sheltered from the blasts that had whirled him hither and thither for seven years past and were to swoop on him again. The embassy was known as Beaumont House; it was in Butcher's Row, a narrow lane which led into the Strand close by St Clement Danes, not far from the boundary line of the City—a timber-framed house with projecting upper stories and barge-boarded gables. The front was decorated with fleur-de-lis and coronets.

Bruno’s heart went out to the younger girl in the family. Perhaps he taught her, as there seems real tenderness in his description: “hardly yet six years of age, she speaks Italian, French and English so equally well that no one can tell her nationality; she plays on the spinet with amazing skill; she dances beautifully; she is a perfect painter.”

The noble lady, who was unwell at the time, still had traces of beauty and was gracious and kind to Bruno. Indeed, such qualities seemed fitting for her soul: she was a lady of judgment, prudence, modesty, and polite dignity.

Wheatley's *History of London* (1904), p. 392 notes that this period was significant in the intellectual history of England. 

Giordano Bruno found himself in an environment where he could engage with scholars and influential figures despite the personal challenges he faced.


Various instruments so that one wonders whether she be  
flesh or spirit, and from her already ripe and noble bearing,  
whether she be of earth or have come down from the skies. Both her parents reappear alike in her body and in her mind.

In a year or two both mother and little daughter were among the dead. However filled with the music of the starry heavens and with immortal thoughts, genius is peculiarly given to live. We can credit Bruno with being very thin-skinned and not a little trying at the fireside. He honestly believed himself to be a model of politeness and self-restraint. He thought that everyone was against him.

“No one ever blamed me  
for discourtesy” — so he assures Castelnau. 

He plunges us into “no one can justly complain of me,”  
a cataract of contrasts in order that we may know how the worthy love and the unworthy maltreat him.
