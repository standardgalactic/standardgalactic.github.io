Behold Bruno landed in France in as bad a plight as ever, or worse; robbed, homeless, with his former patron no longer able to help or protect him and with no prospect of better things. Like Dante, he was a wanderer, almost a beggar, and like Dante, he might have exclaimed: "Verily have I been as a ship without sail or rudder, drifted hither and thither on different refuges, straits, and shores by the bitter blast, the breath of which is wretched poverty." 1


“I accompanied the Ambassador to Paris, where I stayed another year (more exactly seven months), boarding and lodging with gentlemen I knew there, the greater part of the time at my own expense. We may suppose that he was given food and shelter until he found employment. How he supported himself we do not know; he may have had a little money about him, probably he taught; he may have read proofs. He dwelt near the College of Cambrai.

It may be, as Tocco suggests, that he was weary of persecution and wished to pursue his studies under the protection of some great dignitary. So, he would be able to teach unmolested. But, to this end it was necessary for him to reconcile himself with the Church, which he had never abandoned at heart. He had become an outlaw, a reprobate, a child of darkness. So he went boldly to…”

**GIORDANO BRUNO**

Mendoza, who was now the Spanish Ambassador at Paris and represented the ruler of his native province, was judged poorly by Bruno for his character. The Ambassador identified himself wholly with the interests of his Church and country, showed indifference to other matters, and was entirely unscrupulous in pursuing his goals. Bruno said to his judges: "I approached the French Nuncio, Monsignor the Bishop of Bergamo, to whom I was introduced by Don Bernardino de Mendoza, whom I had known at the English Court."


While I strove, with the assistance of these gentlemen, to return to the Church, I consulted another Jesuit. They told me that they could not absolve me for apostasy and that I could not attend divine offices.

I prayed to the Nuncio and earnestly sought his help in writing to His Beatitude, Sixtus V, at Rome, to obtain grace and be received into the bosom of the Catholic Church. However, I wished not to return to monastic life. The Nuncio had no hope and would not write unless I were willing to return to my order. He referred me to Father Alonso Spagnuolo.

I discussed my case with him, and he showed me that it was necessary to procure absolution from censure directly from the Pope, and nothing could be done unless I returned to my order. He further warned me that, being excommunicate, I could not attend divine offices but might listen to sermons and say my prayers in church.

Like Erasmus or More, he hoped that during this time of ferment...


New thought, in the clash between ancient dogma and the new passion for reason, the real government of the Church would prove sagacious and institute some modus vivendi for the genuine thinker; as if the principle of authority could ever be harmonized with intellectual freedom.

Giordano Bruno, a painstaking and somewhat dull person, comes bursting with self-confidence, naturally vain, conscious of not having received his due, and therefore, a trifle self-assertive and even boastful. The carelessness, too, which marked the Nolan.


Bruno's style was evident in his speech. What he had to say was so important that he felt compelled to express it, regardless of whether the occasion was opportune or the listener prepared. Moreover, he was contemptuous of those who hadn't reached his own broad perspective.

The man "subdued to what he worked in" seemed initially interested in Bruno but soon found his visitor's idiosyncrasies irritating. There are no explicit comments, but a diary with selected facts provides implicit commentary; these recounted events show the growing coolness and eventual cessation of their relationship. At their first meeting, Bruno mentioned that he had lectured at Oxford and was about to publish a "Tree of Philosophers," a work that never actually appeared from the press during his lifetime.


Throughout his lifetime, but may be "Anima Adversa Ones" of which the manuscript is at Erlangen. We learn that Bruno's father is still alive in Nola; he himself is lodging near the College of Cambrai. Further conversation turns on an edition of Lucretius.

Bruno comes again the very next day (December 7th), perhaps to consult books, and recounts some passages in his history, of which I have made use. He says he understands and could explain in an hour artificial memory, like that set forth in the first book of "Ad Herennium," which its readers do not comprehend, nor Muret, who admires him as a philosopher.

Corsican nobleman. The diarist is told about theses for the doctorate and enters in Latin that Bruno told him he might skip parts of Saint Augustine’s *a* *i sputatio*. This remark is very characteristic of the hero of our theme. The few Latin words may indicate, so precise is our authority, that Bruno dropped from French into Latin. Perhaps, like most Italians, he did not speak it too well, and this may account for certain erasures and hiatuses in the manuscript. There follows the usual intrepid expression of most intimate opinion, and this to a stranger on the second day of their intercourse! He contemns the subtleties of the Schoolmen and doctrines concerning the sacred matters.


Mentions, even that of the Eucharist, which he says St. Peter and St. Paul were unacquainted with, only knowing that this is my body. He says that with the removal of these questions religious turmoil would disappear, and hopes it will soon be the end of it. But above all, he detests the heretics of France and England because they despise good works and preach the assurance of their faith; justification for Christianity tends wholly towards a life well spent. He scorns Cajetan and Pico della Mirandola and the whole philosophy of the Jesuits outside the subject-matter and intelligence of Aristotle.
