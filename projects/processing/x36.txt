It is better to be frank about one's ignorance than to pretend to false knowledge.

From a perusal of Al-Ghazali, the Arabian theologian, he has learned that religions have a practical object: their ordinances are designed for good conduct and general welfare.


Social needs, peace, and the progress of the State

1. Their authority must be recognized; however, there are as many interpretations of abstract and metaphoric concepts as there are faiths.

Now, early Fathers of the Christian Church such as Tertullian and Augustine taught that much of Scripture should be regarded as purely allegorical. Aquinas emphasized their doctrine, and Dante explained in the vernacular that such speech must accommodate itself to your mind. Scripture condescends to your faculty of comprehension.

6. It was a significant advancement to declare that religious beliefs embody merely a practical attitude and have nothing to do with theoretical truth—an advance on the compromise by William of Ockham and Duns Scotus, who excused the results of their dialectic by asserting that, however much the results of reason may contradict the teachings of the Church, both are equally true. Bruno insisted there should be only one final truth and one reality, with the approach to it being through the free exercise of intellect.


He foresaw the quarrel between science and religion but thought that, if the Scriptures were interpreted in the light of science, this might be avoided! Nay, he is persuaded that lofty minds will find support in religion more than in any other source.

He adopts an ancient device quite ingenuously; he quotes everything from the Scriptures that suits his purpose and interprets them to his own end. However, by populating stars and planets with beings both better and worse than ourselves, he undermines central Christian doctrines of the Fall and Redemption.

He is fully aware that thinkers and investigators of nature face a challenging journey in their aim to overcome contradictions and arrive at unity.

Underlying them is the notion: 

“O difficulties to be endured,” cries the coward, the feather-head, the shuttlecock, the faint-hearted. The task is not impossible though hard. The craven must stand aside. Ordinary, easy tasks are for the commonplace and the herd. Rare, heroic, and divine men overcome the difficulties of the way and force an immortal palm from necessity. You may fail to reach your goal. Run the race nevertheless. Put forth your strength in so high a business. Strive on with your last breath.

He is always conscious of the importance of his own labors: “The Nolan has given freedom to the human spirit and made its knowledge free. It was suffocating in the close air of a narrow prison-house, whence, but only through chinks, it gazed at the far-off stars. Its wings were clipped so that it was unable to cleave the veiling...”


Cloud and reach the reality beyond.
