He introduces symbolic verse of his own composition and gives us brisk dialogue between Hermes, Philotimus, and others.


Logifer, with thrusts less severe than those which were to follow, targeted doctors and masters of the schools. Scholars had traveled a far road from the elegant Latin of Cicero. Bruno's Latin is full of neologisms; his syntax is convoluted, and his prosody is abominable. In a later work, he acknowledges that his Latin is coarse and rough. However, it is alive. One finds elements of Bruno's manner in this early work, which may be conveniently examined here.

He delights in brisk and varied dialogue that knows no curb. Sometimes the thread of mystical symbolism running through it naturally expresses itself in meter; occasionally, he breaks into verse, written with impetuous fury just as his prose. At its worst, one is reminded that he came from the land of improvvisatori. He is far too much in a hurry to be overly careful about style and never dreams of polish. For him, the thing he has to declare is infinitely more important than the manner of declaring it. Later, he hinted at being too diffuse.


1. But he failed to amend his ways. In his verses, there is little of craftsman-like skill. His pen flows as rapidly as his thoughts; his mind is full to bursting point; he indulges in wide circlings and side-long sweeps. He casts about for the most unlikely allegory. For him, as for Dante, Swedenborg, and Emerson, all nature and all the products of the human mind are symbolic of higher truth; and in this, he fell into line with the conviction of his century, perceiving deep analogies in fact and fable, whether sacred or profane.

Hence, in an age of respect for authority, he supports an argument by drawing on his own vast lore; he lugs in learning not for display but to reinforce his meaning. He does this quite impartially: the Bible, the Pre-Socratic philosophers, the Cabala, and classic myth are introduced as of equal weight. There is real unity underlying each of his works; but all


Give the impression of disorder. For each trivial occasion, each intruding half-thought is like a spark which he allows to burst into vivid and vagrant flame; his imagination plays riotously around his immediate theme and then suddenly leaps aside. Sometimes this is a trick done on purpose. If the men of the Renaissance rejoiced in life, toward the close of the period they expressed their vigor in violence. Hence Bruno never missed an opportunity to keep his readers awake by the oddness of his antics; he surprised them with bombardments and unexpected raking fires.

He thought to throw each noble design and lofty thought into relief by the dodge (not wholly unknown to modern authors) of smart paradox. Prolixity and the grossly grotesque entertained his age: they bore ours. All is overdone: there is not a thought of repose. Penetrative insight, soaring imagination, novel wisdom, severe thought have a setting of jest and jeer, clumsy buffoonery, and sheer indecency. He was justified in being sure of...


himself; but his bombastic self-assertion repels the modern reader. He delights in contrast and invective. His polemic is implacable and often unjust, but less so than that of his contemporaries and immediate successors, and he flies less readily than they to the final argument of abuse. As Tocco remarks, his motive is always noble; he "made no thought of life" and proved it by sacrifice, suffering, and sealing his faith in death.

II. THE INCANTATION OF CIRCE

Books of the period bore odd titles to catch the eye. Bruno called his next work the "Cantus Circaeus," or "The Incantation of Circe." It forms men into beasts, discusses with her handmaiden the human vice which each kind of beast represents, and each beast and its vice are memorized under initial letters. Now the nature of memory is occult, and the recalling of The Homeric sorceress, who trans...


Idea may be regarded as a sort of magical process. So, the art of memory may be regarded as a fascinating incantation. The dialogue is full of bitter satire on human depravity. A second dialogue follows with different interlocutors. It treats more directly and precisely than the previous "Art of Memory" that subject. There is an attempt to localize the functions of the brain as the physical conditions of mental processes.

The principle of the association of ideas is more closely followed than in *De Umbris* and copious illustrations of method are given. The work abounds in obscurities, which were as attractive to superior minds in that age as in our own. Later on, Bruno found it convenient to be occasionally obscure where it was wiser to suggest merely to those few who had the capacity really to understand perilous doctrine. But Bruno never erred on the side of over-caution!

**The Early Works**

**III. The Lullian Architecture**

In the same year appeared a third book, the "Brief Architecture of the Art of Lully With Its Completion." It was published by Gorbin and was little more than a reproduction of Lully's Great Art. However, Bruno thought of this art as a key to the structure of the universe and a path to complete philosophy, proceeding from foundations of all knowledge he conceived of it as a demonstration of unity, the shortest road for thought and memory, and a useful symbolic logic. Of the value of inference in "extending knowledge," Bruno had little more notion than Lully did. For, although Lully worked outside scholasticism and exhibited much spontaneous originality—which we find evident today—Bruno saw it as an integral part of his philosophical framework.


In Scotus Eriugena before scholasticism began, medieval thought was harnessed in the syllogism and employed itself in ceaseless rotation, like a donkey round a grinding mill, but mostly grinding philosophic chaff. In Bruno's time, Lully captured many able minds and had great vogue. Before Kant, it was not possible to work from other than dogmatic premises; certain concepts were posited as fundamental and ultimate, with no notion of submitting them to criticism. For Bruno, the art of Lully was alive; for us, it has become dead and valueless.

Lully tried to prove the dogmas of the Church by human reason. In this work, Bruno denies that they are reasonable: any attempt to prove their truth is a blunder.


Christianity is irrational, contrary to philosophy and in disagreement with other religions. We only accept it by faith and through revelation. As a Neo-Platonist and syncretist, he relies on and quotes pagan authority as freely as Christian.

74 GIORDANO BRUNO

Berti thinks that at some time before Bruno left France, he wrote a book, never published, of which all we know is that two years later, he promised to send his English friend Smith his "Purgatory of Hell," wherein you shall see the fruit of redemption. One judges from the context that the redemption was from scientific and philosophic error.

IV. THE CHANDLER

The same year (1582) saw another work from Bruno.
