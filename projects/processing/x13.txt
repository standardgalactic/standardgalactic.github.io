It was common enough for monks to doff the habit and don the gayest attire; but they were bound to retain the scapular: to cast this aside was regarded as a very serious offense.

On the road to Bergamo, while resting at Brescia, he seems to have found a monk shut up because he had given.


**Way to a Prophetic Impulse:** The poor brother thought himself a great theologian and spoke with tongues. Bruno gave him vinegar and polypod and restored him to the brethren, "the same ass that he was." Similarly, Johannes Silvius cured a demoniac with a little necessary medicine.

We know that [Johannes] visited Milan because he tells us it was in that place that he first heard of a future friend and helper.

40 **GIORDANO BRUNO**

Sir Philip Sidney, "that very illustrious and excellent cavalier," whose acute spirit, not to speak of his renowned manners, ...


It is so rare that it were difficult to find his like outside Italy or within it. Sidney had been travelling in Italy two or three years before, unattended by the usual bear-leader, and studied at Padua. At Venice, he got Paul Veronese to paint his portrait. Italy was the indispensable but highly dangerous finishing school for the courtier in manners, letters, art, and life. Roger Ascham tells us that the Englishman usually returned worse transformed than ever was any in Circe’s Court, and that during the nine days which he himself spent in Venice, he found “more liberty to sin than ever I heard tell of in our noble city of London in nine years.” Sidney wrote to Languet that if the Turks should conquer Italy, its vile allurements would so ensnare them that they would tumble down without...


Being pushed.

“ Sidney appears to have been one of the very few who listened to the enchantment of the Siren’s song untouched.”

Bruno made his way over the snows of Mont Cenis with the intention of trying his fortune at Lyons. At the end of the long, deep, inhospitable valley along which the mule track wound above the rushing waters of the Arc, he came to an inviting, fertile region where, built beside two rivers and between two hills, lay the capital of Savoy.

A Dominican monastery was built in Chambéry thirty years before; but he found no very kindly reception thereat. He complained to an Italian monk who chanced to be there at the time and who replied, “I forewarn you that you will get no civility in these parts, and the farther you go,”


"There will be less of it.

"Whereupon, Bruno decided to leave the route for Lyon and take the one to Geneva."

Chapter V  
AT GENEVA, LYONS AND TOULOUSE  

For three years, Bruno sojourned in various Italian states, receiving hospitality in spacious, dignified monasteries or under the homelier shelter of some kindly Italian roofs. Nowhere were the refinements of life wanting.

Across the mountains, he found a stern, rough folk who knew not the use of the fork or the amenities of the table. The guest at the inn was called upon to share his bed with more than one bedfellow and might consider himself fortunate if he arrived at the inflexible hour for the common meal and had neither to forfeit it nor tarry for it.

At Naples, Bruno read St Augustine in secret."


So we may suppose that he felt some interest in his writings. The austere and naked theology of that Father had been strengthened and hardened by John Calvin. That remarkable fugitive from France to Geneva carried with him even more of the vigor of the legislator than of the dexterity of the controversialist. Conscientious in his rejection of a mediating priesthood, he nonetheless was visited by no scruples when he established at Geneva that worst of theocratic governments—the tyranny of a board of theologians. His sectaries established and maintained the outward form of a “city of God,” less accomplished, less broad-minded, and even more coercive than ever Rome had been; and, when Calvin died, his mantle fell on a man of like mind—his fellow-exile, Theodore de Bèze of Vézelay. Hardly more than twenty years before 4142 Giordano Bruno


At his arrival, Calvin’s fervent zeal for petty theological doctrines persuaded him to betray Miguel Servetus y Reves to the Inquisition. When Servetus escaped and sought asylum in Geneva, it was Calvin who sent him to the stake.

Under Béze, drastic discipline was dealt out to anyone who offended against the most meticulous article prescribed by the autocratic congregation of theologians who formed a state within the political state and were supreme over it.

Nevertheless, Bruno knew that Geneva opened its gates to those who sought refuge for conscience's sake. Independent thinkers from his beloved Italy had found asylum there and established an Italian evangelical church dating back to 1542. Bruno put up at a hostelry and inscribed his name at the Academy. One may still read in the Rector’s...
