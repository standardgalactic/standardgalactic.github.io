PREFACE
THE life OfBruno has been written in English more than
once, and he has had many excellent commentators . NO
one can now Write about him without availing himself very
largely Of
”
the solid and scholarly work done by Tocco, Fio
ren ti nO, Berti
, Brun nhofer, Mc Inty re and others . The apology
for the appearance Ofthe present work must be that some
facts , unrecorded in England, have come to light Of late
years, and also that a few usual
, almost unavoidable i n
accuracies require correction . Moreover,
I have tried to
follow the development OfBruno
’
s thoughts in the order in
which he declared them ; and, on one or two points ,
I find
my
self compelled to differ from the conclusions Ofthis or
the other commentator .
Most OfBruno
’
s works have been published in the editions
OfWagner, Lagarde,
and GfrOrer, well edited for their day .
Different libraries contain different editions , when any are
to be found in them . Even the British Museum, although
it possesses a fine collection of rare, original impressions,
does not contain all the volumes of the complete State
Edition , and lacks that one which contains the works which
were discovered in manuscript . TO give the paging Ofan y
particular edition might therefore prove less convenient tha n
the plan } have adopted Ofgiving those indications for re
ference which are s upplied by the subdivisions Ofthe works
themselves , except in the case of the published manuscripts .
GIORDANO BRUNO
Those who wish to verify a reference will thereby readily do
so and may discover that reading the context is not a wholly
unprofitable task . I have given minuter detail as to other
works from which I have drawn or which throw light on
the subject-matter .

A , TRAVELLER, curious to try the local line which runs
eastward from Naples, after journeying a few meandering
miles through a generous and beautiful country-side, will
find his train halting at the little city of Nola . Should he
descend, he would not come across anything strikingly
picturesque or architecturally memorable . There are few
vestiges of the remote past ; even the mediaeval cathedral
is a restoration . On an eminence, a ruined fortress still
dominates Campa

ee the happy fields —as the
inhabitants call their plain ; and, as OfOld time,
the vine
yards are lavish in the production Of“ mangi aguerra,
” a
thick black wine . The , sky is very lucid ;
the air sweet
and
'
soft ;
the eye may range over the rich and varied
plain to Monte S
'
omma (which hides Vesuvius)
and to
other guardian f hills .
Outside the walls Of Nola there stood in the mid l 6th
century, Cicala , a hamlet Of “ four or five houses, none
Ofthem too imposing ;
” 1 and here,
in there was
born to a soldier in the service Ofthe Spanish masters Of
Naples, one Gioan Bruno and his wife, a man child . The

infant was destined to become a precursor Of modern
science and philosophy,
to cast a search-light into dark
places and bring forth hidden things ;
it was hi
s fate to
wander, an excommunicated and fugitive priest,
through
many lands ,
impelled, heedless Ofself, partly by a restless
nature but chiefly because Ofa certain missionary z eal for
truth and desire to set the intellect free from the fetters
Of authority ; he was to endure strange vicissitudes in
penury, years Of solitary suffering at the hands of the
Inquisition because he claimed
“ philosophic freedom in
thought and speech, and , finally,
to pass from its crue
‘
l
dungeons
“ a flame to the flames . He was born in the
very year which saw an outbreak at Naples against a
contemplated introduction Ofthe Spanish Inquisiti on .
Bruno tells us that his mother
’
s name was Frauli s s a
fi
‘
She was Ofa family called S av oli n i or S auli n i . Probably
Fiorentino
2 was
”
right In connecting her singular baptismal
name with German mercenaries , whose Italian wives may
very well have been so called ; and certainly some Ofthe
multitude Of mercenary troops drawn from beyond the
Alps had settled in the neighbourhood .
3 As to the social
status Ofthe Bruni and many similar problems, much has
been conjectured and no certainty achieved . It would seem
probable that the family was very far from being wealthy,
but had some claim to gentility.

been a branch Ofthe noble family Ofthat name at Asti .

BIRTH AND PARENTAGE— BOYHOOD 3
The child wa s christened Felipe (Philip)
. Perhaps his
father named him after the heir to the throne OfCharles V,
as it would become a loyal soldier to do . We shall see how
he came by the name OfGiordano .
Gioan Bruno would seem to have been a caustic critic Of
life ;
for his son tells us that when , after supper, a friend
declared that
'
he had never before felt so happy, Gioan
retorted :
“ that is because you have never before been so
frivolous .
” 1 Probably Gioan was a man Ofparts ;
for it is
accepted by most of the best authorities that he counted
Tan sillo,
the Neapolitan poet ,
courtier and cavalier, among
his friends .
2 Ta n s illo, although not born at Nola,
came Of
Nolan stock he never stayed long at Nola , but made a few
hurried visits thither .
3 Felipe may have seen more Ofhim,
later
'
on , at Naples . Anyhow, many works S how how
deeply Tan s illo Impressed his mind during the plastic years
he introduces the poet into his dialogues ; he adopts Tan
s illo
’
s style in his own poems , and he Often equals his master,
though, usually, he falls short Ofhim in grace,
smoothness
and elegance ; he even incorporates a little Of Ta n s illo
’
s
work with his own; Any passing visit paid by Tan s illo to
Nola would produce a strong impressi on on the little lad ;
for the good folk around were Ofa different order .
In the cottages hard by dwelt certain members Ofhis
mother
’
s family .

who went once a year, on Good Friday,
to his crony,
the
curate,
to confess . Absolution was freely given , and, when
the year came round again , Father ,
”
he would say,
to
day
’
s sins finish up the year whereupon the good priest
would reply, And so does to-day
’

peace and sin no more .
” 1
The rustics Of the neighbourhood were a home-S pun
people, rough and ready Oftongue and Ofcaustic wit . They
took the facts Oflife with unsophisticated directness and
retained very ancient usages,
celebrating the vintage with
classic Obscenity and shocking the Viceroy thereby.
2 Al
though degraded by centuries Ofmisgovernment and Oppres
sion ,
the southern Italian had not lost his intellectual vigour
or his readiness to abandon himself to the enjoyment Of
simple pleasures, as if all creatures were dwelling in the
sunrise Ofeternity . The Nolans were markedly s upers ti
tious, even for a credulous age . They beheld spirits in
deserted places— by an ancient temple and where the bodies
Ofthe plague-stricken had been buried poltergeists played
tricks on them, and Bruno records how, when a child, he him
self beheld S pirits On hills where beeches and l aurels grew .
3
The quick eye Ofthe child noted the peculiarities Ofhis
neighbours and the small events Ofhis life; and he never
forgot them . Years afterwards, when in exile, he introduces
the honest
, kindly folk OfNola, not without irony, as inter
locutors in his dialogues
4
; he delights in recalling many
details which he had Observed— the produce Ofhis father
’
s
garden ,
the melon-plot OfFranz ino,
the smell Ofburnt hair
when Vesta,
the wife OfAlben ti O, used curling-tongs, and
how she would shake her head ; he remembers hearing the

the tailor, and
how he saw Paulino, given to blasphemy, stoop to heave up
a great shovelful Ofearth and break the red string which
held his breeches up . Character after character,
incident
after incident, crowd in on his memory : he may have had
personal ex perl en ce Ofthe bugs which infested the wooden
bedstead OfCos ta ti nO .
1 The lad
’
s eye was alive to beauty
too ;
to the pure sky,
tremulous with excess Oflight,
the
mystery Ofthe shadowy hills ,
the bounty Ofthe corn-laden
plain . In exile he recalls the glory and glamour Of the
world whi ch ~were given to his childhood, and is never weary
Ofthinking Of the golden fields OfNola
”
;
2 his birthplace
ever remained for
‘ him a place

” 3 he
ranks the rich Campagna with Araby and the garden Of
the Hesperides,

speaks Of himself and was known as
the Nolan ,
”
and calls his philosophy the Nolan es e .
5 Other
Nolans felt like Bruno . Ambrogio Leone tells Ofone who,
returning home after only two or three days
’
absence, cast
himself on his native soil and kissed it with unspeakable
rapture .
The observant child had Often gaz ed across at Vesuvius
from vine-bearing Cicala and noticed how bare and
forbidding it looked . But one day his father took him
thither, and he found its l pes covered with luxuriant
trees and bountiful vegetation , while Cicala,
. in its turn ,
had become d ar k and dim and distant . Astonished at
the strange change,
”
he writes,
“ I became aware, for the
first time,
that sight could deceive .
” 6 The seed Ofdou bt
was sown ; he would soon ask : What are the grounds Of
certitude

Influences of the gen i us loci could not fail to affect an
impressionable,
imaginative child . TO every Italian child
the past calls with living voice ; antiquity is real
;
some
times i t lulls to sleep , sometimes is a rousing force ;
it is
never, as with the Northern child, a dull dream concerning
men who were never really alive, whose voices come as the
hollow croakings OfShades . NOW, Nola was a poor little
place but it had been a great and noble city ;
it was one of
the most ancient in Italy ;
it was the Uria Ofthe Etruscans .
The citiz ens boasted loudly Oftheir descent from a Calchi
dian Colony . Thrice had Hannibal been repulsed from the
gates . Nola had been the chosen home OfRoman wealth
and fashion ;
the great Augustus died there . True, Ofits
massive walls ,
its twelve gates and its two amphitheatres
nothing remained ancient marbles were built into cottage
and pigs ty e and vineyard-wall but the labourer
’
s spade
Often opened up some sepulchre crowded with the famous
funeral urns OfNola, and his plough would reveal the long
buried treasures Ofancient coin and medallion . The little
Bruno s aw many a cla s s 1c custom Observed at wedding
feast and popular festival and even In religious rite . He
would hear Offamous citiz ens , Ofwhom Nolans were very
proud,
such as Ambrogio Leone,
the scholar, and Giovanni
da Nola,
the sculptor .
1 Felipe Bruno moved among a
people who derived their life-blood from Etruscan and yet
more ancient sources,
from Greeks, Romans, Teutons ,
Moors and Spaniards ;
they were quick, astute and versa
tile, very human ,
as volcanic as their soil, debased, but not
so degenerate as they became after three more centuries Of
misrule .
Such were the influences we know Of which moulded
the mind Oflittle Felipe in his earliest and most formative
years .

We do not know In what manner he was educated at
Nola, but he must have been a promising pupil
,
for,
at
about the age Ofeleven , he was sent to Naples to study
humane letters ,
logic and dialectic

in other words , Latin
language and literature, probably S ome Greek , philosophy,
and the modes Ofeffective reasoning and expression .

was a weaverOfvelvet in Naples at the time . He attended
the public lectures of II S arn es e, probably one Vicenz o
COlle OfSarno, who published,
later on , a work
'
call ed The
destruction Ofthe destructions OfBaldwin , which , moreover,
the destroyer has fulfilled
" 3
-ah extraordinary title, de
signed,
as was customary,
to hit the eye Of the reading
public . Besides these public lectures,
“ I received,

he
says,
private lessons in logic from Fra TeOfilO da Var
anO, an Augustinian monk, who afterwards lectured on
Metaphysic in Rome.
” 4 Bruno also told
'
a n acquaintance,
in 1 5 8 5 ,
that an Augustinian monk, whose name the hearer
did not catch or did not remember, had been his main
teacher in philosophy .
5
I t is noteworthy that in two Ofhis
works
6 he calls the interlocutor who ex presses his own

“ lover of God

himself ;
7 but it would be quite In his manner to discharge
at the same time some sense Of Obligation to Teofilo da

benefits he received . It is clear that the very young scholar
received an impetus towards speculative thinking from Fra
TeofilO. But independen t thinking had well nigh ceased
to be in Italy ; and in most Ofthe Protestant centres Of
learning also . The contests between the Papacy and the
R eformers had led to the vigorous enforcement OfOpposed
dogmas throughout Europe, and throughout Italy the edicts
of Trent ran under the protecting shadow Ofthe neigh
bouri ng Vatican .
Bruno tells us that
, when a boy, he studied the works
OfPeter Of Ravenna on memory.
1 The scholars Ofthe
Renaissance had discovered hOw much the ancient orators
employed dodges for remembering,
and they studied the
mnemonics OfQuintus Corni fi ci us , which they and Bruno
attributed to Cicero .
2 They directed their attention to the
subject for a good memory was a precious possession even
after the art Ofprinting by type was discovered, since books
were very clear and, Owing to a want Ofdeveloped organi
z ation in the book-trade, were hard to come at and Often
had to be fetched from afar . Peter OfRavenna
’
s Phoeni x
3
went through several editions . Corn i fi ci u s and all the
Older writ
‘
ers made use Of visual memory,
S i nce t hat is
stronger than auditory memory in most people,
and taught
how to imagi ne some vacant space, such as a temple; and
fill it with suggestive images ,
thus using the principle Of
the association Ofideas,

and other authors, who followed Corn ifi ci us closely, with
his own psychological and metaphysical conclusions, and
hi s knowledge Ofthe subject proved to be useful as an
introduction and means Oflivelihood in city after city, and
especially in France and Germany, where much attention
was given to the subject and where fresh books on memory
were produced for each generation , at least, during the
1 6th century .
1
What career should he follow ! Education was difficult
to Obtain and very expensive . The times were troubled .
Neapolitans were beggared by the heavy taxes imposed to
put down the Protestant revolt against Philip in the Low
Countries the civil administration was abominable ;
the
police and even the judges were corrupt ; brigands infested
the country-side and increased the desolation which earth
quake, famine and pest had brought about . What Bruno
now wi tnessed or heard Ofbranded itself in his memory .
“ If[Hydra] long for carrion ,
”
said he, when 111 England,
let him go stay in the Campagna or the highway between
Rome and Naples , where so many robbers are
”
quartered ;
for there at every step he will have more sumptuous ban
quets Offresh flesh than in any other part Ofthe world .
” 2
Even high society was infested by cheats and thieves ;
the
kingdom was riddled with heresy, and heretics were pur
sued and ex termmated with barbarous cruelty . Turkish
buccaneers raided the coast, burning and slaying and
capturing women and children for the slave-market .

The lad was In love with learning ;
thought he had
caught a glimpse Ofthe high white star OfTruth there

was but one refuge for a youth with no great means— the
Cloister, with all its opportunities and lettered ease . The
Church was very weal thy : it possessed two-thirds Ofthe
landed property in Naples . An d the order OfDominic the
Spaniard was the most powerful and rich Ofthe monastic
bodies and enjoyed the full support OfPhilip and his coun
s ellors . In his fifteenth year, a time Oflife when it was
impossible for Felipe to comprehend anything like the full
nature and implication Ofmonastic vows and Obligations
or the real spirit Ofthe Cloister, he entered that Dominican
Order Ofwhich the first requiremen t was intellectual sub
mission . He would be trained by men who were called
“ hounds Ofthe Lord and whose special function was to
uphold doctrine and to scent out heresy as dogs are employed
to scent out truffles .
1 This was the first Ofthe long series
Of sardonic ironies which Fate had provided for Felipe
Bruno .

naturally impelled, putteth his mind into fetters,
so that,
from being free in manhood, he becometh a slave under a
most Vile and subtle hypocrisy .
” 1 The reverberations Of
independent thought still lingered in Southern Italy ; nor,
perhaps, did convent-walls wholly !
shut them out . He
frankly told his judges at Venice that he
“ began to doubt
the doctrine OfThree distinct Persons in the Trinity from
the age Ofeighteen ; and,
indeed, Augustine declared the
term Person to be new in his time ; but I have never
denied the dogma— only doubted .
” 2 His acute and vigorous
intellect was already at work ,
framing a philosophy,
trans

he
told the Inquisi tors ,
“ when I was a novice ,
in order to

for having
given away the images Of St . Catherine of Sienna and,
possibly, St . Anthony,

it was imputed to me that I despised the images Ofsaints
and also for having told a novice, who was reading the

that
he should cast it aside and read some other book instead,

‘ Lives Ofthe Holy Fathers

tore this document up the same day .

c iplin e ordered by the Council OfTrent had not yet taken
effect in the monastery ; and so little cause OfOffence did
the fathers find in Bruno (who was a close student, and
whose converse was probably chiefly with books)
that he
became subdeacon and deacon in due course and was
admitted to the priesthood in 1 572 , he being then 24 years
Ofage .

then wore the tiara ; and he presented it to him,
2 probably
when he was summoned to Rome . For,
the monks could
not fail to
\
talk about the brilliant man they had secured ;
Bruno had devoted some attention to mnemonics, and his
reputation reached the Papal Court . Later, an acquaintance
in Pari s
‘
en tered in his diary :
“ Jordan us told me that
Pope Pius V and Cardinal Rebiba summoned him from
Naples,
and he was brought to Rome in a coach to
set forth his Artificial Memory. He recited the Psalm
F undamen ta
3
in Hebrew, and taught something Of this
to Rebiba .

“ Noah

the first fruit Of his genius, has dis
appeared . We know that he crowded the ark with all
manner

Of creatures, each probably symboliz ing some
human virtue or folly . The animals struggled for the seat
Ofhonour— the poop— a current metaphor for the faculty
Of Reason ;
the Gods granted the distinction to the ass ;
but he ran some danger Oflosing it, because his was a case
of hoofs, not horns .

preserved in two later books ;

written , although not revised and finished, during this
monastic period .
Bruno says : Being at the time at a monastery of my
order,
called St . Bartholomew,
in the city Of Campagna,
some distance from Naples, but in the Kingdom,
I chanted
my first mass there ; and I continued to wear the Dominican
habit
,
celebrating mass and the divine Offices under Obedience
to my superiors and the Priors Ofmonasteries, wherever I
was , up to the year 1 576 . Doubtless he diligently searched
through the library Ofevery religious house Of which he
was a temporary inmate . He could have found but little
in common with his monkish associates, except that some
Ofthem would possess a tincture Ofthat learnin g on which
the
“ Angelic Doctor,
” who cast distinction on their order,
had set his seal .
Even candid , courageous Sarpi tells us that he found
himself compelled to wear a mask .
1 Bruno
’
s was a very
penetrable disguise . The habit concealed a fierce intel
lectual flame : it had burst forth once ;
it could not but
show itself again ;
“
the cowl does not make the monk .
”
Here was a man of vast S piritual
‘
energy, Of singularly
open character, one not to be scared by legend or suppressed
by authority, resolute to know at first hand, strong
-headed
if not headstrong, and brave to rashness . Soon the monks
OfSt . Dominic had a taste Ofthe essence
”
Oftheir young
priest . Now that he was in fu ll orders , and therefore less
under direction , he indulged in a frankness Ofspeech which
speedily brought him into serious peril . At this time
Arianism had found foothold in the South, and many had
departed from “ the fixed highway to the Infinite and
Eternal . Bruno told the Inquisitors :
“ On e day, during a
discussion with Montalcino, one Ofour order,
in the com
pany of other fathers, he said that heretics were ignorant
1 S arp
i
, Fra Pa olo ; Lott . 2 37 .

folk and used no scholastic terms ; whereto I replied that
indeed they did not set forth their conclusions in the
scholastic manner ; but they came to the point, as did the
fathers Of the Church
”
;
and then Bruno proceeded to
show, as an example,
that Arius was not without some
kind of support from St . Augustine
1 “ I shewed the view
Of
’ Arius to be less dangerous than it was commonly taken
to be ;
for it was generally understood that Arius meant
to teach that the Word was the first creation of the Father
and I explained that Arius said the Word was neither
Creator nor Created, but intermediary between the Creator
and the creature,
j ust as the spoken word is an intermediary
between the speaker and the meaning he sets forth ; and
that,
for this reason,
it is called the First-born before all
creatures ;
through which, and not out Ofwhich all things
are ; n ot to which, but through which all things return to
their final end, which is the Father .
” 2
It is unfortunate
that the Founder OfChristianity and His Apostles were as
silent about such high matters as if they had been agnostics ,
while the Fathers gave vague and contradictory answers to
those important questions which the Roman Church had
by this time definitely and precisely answered with one
theologic scheme,
the Eastern Church with another,
those
unsuccessful disturbers Of Christian peace,
the earlier
heretics , with more, and t
he Protestants with several new
Ones . Bruno, who had read the Christian fathers and the
Schoolmen carefully, was in the right
; and Montalcino
appears to have reported the conversation at head-quarters .
This was not the sole count against Bruno .
“ The Pro
v i nci al drew up a process against me on certai n charges
Ofwhich I remain wholly ignorant ; but I was told that he
was proceeding against me for fresh heresy,
and was
reviving the affair of my novitiate ; and I ni i s doubted I
1 Doc. x i

should find myself in prison .
” 1 Bruno was no longer in
the hands of the Director of Novitiates, but, as priest,
answerable to the Provincial Father. A charge of heresy,
therefore, might be fraught with very serious consequences .
The Papal States , which adjoined the Kingdom, were the
only possible refuge . S O, he continues,
I left Naples
and went to Rome
”
;
thus commencing a life Ofturmoil
and ceaseless wandering through Europe, which was to
endure for six teen years ,
to be followed by nearly eight
years Ofimprisonment, and to end at the stake .

BR UNO must have been a marvel of intellectual industry .
Interested in all t hings , burning to know, he must have
put every spare moment at the monastery to good purpose
for his education was vast and varied . A good memory
helped him though sometimes one finds it
,
like the equally
excellent memory of Macaulay, a trifle inaccurate ;
certainly
he owed more to nature than to the systematiz ed mnemonic
art in which he believed . He spoke Spanish ,
1
like all the
cultivated people of the Kingdom .
” Latin , Ofcourse, was
a living language ,
spoken by every educated monk and
scholar. Bruno
’
s works give evidence of a wide range of
reading in the Roman classics , and they contain many
quotations from the Roman poets,
especially from Lucretius ,
Virgil and Ovid . But his eager, romantic mind did not
allow Ofbeing moulded ~by such studies into classic reserve
and equipoise . He ac ired an intimate acquaintance with
the literature Ofthat graceful
, unlaboured daughter OfLatin
— his own tongue;
that he commanded the great poets, Dante,
Ariosto and Tasso ,
references and quotations in his works
S how but he especially valued the sugared conceits and
strained manner OfTan s illo and the decadent Neapolitan
school . The on e play he wrote indicates the study of
Bibbiena and Aretino no less than of Plautus and Terence .
He knew Greek , and shows a mastery of Aristotle in

the original unequalled by any scholar of his time . Aris
totl e was part of a Dominican

s education ,
for Albertus
Magnus
/
and Aquinas had effected the Church
’
s acceptance
I
of the Stagirite as
“ topmost authority,
’ “ worthiest of
faith and Obedience.
” 1 Petrarch,
indeed, dared to say
that, after all
, Aristotle was only a man ; and,
recently,
Cornelius Agrippa, who lived and died in the bosom
of Mother Church , had attacked Aristotle ;
so had Ramus
and others but all recent onslaughts on Aristotle
’
s autho
rity were regarded as inroads on orthodox belief. Not
merely did Bruno possess a masterly knowledge of Aristotle ,
bu t, by reason of his ben t towards natural science, he
made close acquaintance with the chief classical and
Arabian commentators ,
translations of the latter having
been published not long before . At first he accepted the
cosmology of this most logical and comprehensive of
thinkers ; and certainly Aristotle
’
s teaching would impress
on him the need of an attentive observation , which that
master did not always carry out . The more observant
scholars of the sixteenth century were aware that men
have not more teeth than women ,
2 or two more sutures
in the brain-pan ;
3
tha t they have more than sixteen ribs ,
‘1
and that the back of the crani um is not an empty space .
5
When Bruno studied Copernicus he came to regard the
Stagirite as a clog to human progress . Unlike Aristotle,
he cannot be charged with
“ moderation to excess
”
: b e
accused that
“ master of those
‘ who know
” 6 of relying
on his own invention more than on fact and of being a
desiccated sophisticator of truth, perhaps instigated by un
worthy motives

s
“ Fountain of Life he had only indirect
knowledge ; but he gathered its drift from comments and
quotations, and perceived thereby that the Aristotelian
categories of Form and Matter cannot be regarded as
ultimate , but require an underlying unity .
’1 From Algaz el
he learned how much habit has to do with the formation
of belief ;
that sacred writings concern practice, not theory,
and,
consequently, employ the unscientific conceptions ,
current at the time,
to enforce moral truth only.
5
He had to read the Fathers of the Church, who were re
garded as important elements in the education of a Domi
nican monk, whose intellectual discipline lay in subtle
distinctions and metaphysical refinements of thought . In
this respect the schoolmen excel
; no
'
men have exhibited
S uch subtle discrimination : it was they who built up the
triple wall of Catholic defence . The schoolmen ,
therefore,
were studied by Bruno , whose acute mind appreciated the
power and profundity of men who were so seriously handi
capped by authority and by the jealous watchfulness of
Religion . Some years later a Parisian scholar noted in his
diary : He (Bruno)
ran ks St Thomas above all in his
S umma Con tra Gen tiles an d Questi on ibus Di sputa ti s ;

respect for the doctors of the Catholic Church , and es peci

I said before, I
have ever valued and loved as mine own soul

book De M ona d e these words,

peripatetic philosophy.
’ 1
mainly because he was one who sought for a coherent body of
truth ,
completing the work of his master, Albrecht of KOln .
Aquinas hammered the logical works of Aristotle and Chris
Aquinas commanded his respect
tian dogmas into one whole ; nay, more,
it was he who
made an even bolder attempt than that of Albrecht to con
dense all the knowledge ofhis time into an encyclopaedic
statement . The great spirit of Aquinas still seems to haunt
his ancient home in Naples and still impresses itself on the
best monks of his order . Bruno also admired Albrecht of
KOln (Albertus Magnus
)
and declared that he had no equal
in his time and far surpassed Aristotle .
” 2 Perhaps he
rated this great schoolman so high 3 because of his little
book on Alchemy ; a subject which embraced much of the
very inconsiderable knowledge of nature which men pos
sessed in the thirteenth century .
But, except as an
‘
i ntellectual Whetstone, such study is
the least fruitful
; and the i nadequacy of formal logic to
scientific investigation (
useful as it proves for the detection
of deductive fallacy) was soon apparent to Brti n o.
‘ Over
and over again in his works he expresses his scorn for
the barren l ogic of the Peripatetics for they not only
blindly follow Aristotle, but they misconstrue him and avert
their eyes from gaz ing at natural things . Could Aristotle

have been summoned from the grave he had been with
Bruno .
Perhaps it was as a part of his theologic education that
Bruno applied himself to Hebrew . We know that he
recited the 8 6th Psalm in the original before the Pope ;
1 he
uses Hebrew letters as symbols , and would appear to have
attributed some mystic significance to the language .
I I . THE NEO-PLATONI S TS
When the literature of Hellas reached Italy in the previous
century,
the soil was ripe for its reception . Scholasticism
had exhausted itself. Men w ere weary of dead distortions ,
desiccated dissections of reality, and they turned their eyes
from the mediaeval museum to Plato,
“ the dove cleaving
the thi n ai r, and to Plotinus ,
the eagle soaring over
Plato
’
s tomb .
” They listened no longer to tired, wearisome
voices from the Cloister, and they hailed Plato and Plotinus
as heavenly messengers . Plotinus and the Alexandrian
scholars , repelled by Aristotelian formalism,
tried to grasp
the flow of life,
its passion and the source of its passion , by
insight rather than by di s curs w e thought ; and, what they
achieved,
they strove to ex press in allegory and metaphor ;
for they felt the impossibility of putting ultimate reality into
logical form .
2 Fi ci n o and his fellows translated Plato and
the Neo-Platonists , and Bruno read these translations as
well as the Platonic writings of the translators . We know
from his character and from his N eo-Platonic works
3 how
he must have lived in his own enthusiasm and found
spiritual nourishment in thoughts too vital
, not merely to

3 Notably from the Eroi ci . Also from De Umbr i s an d S igi llus
DISCIPLI NE OF BOOKS 2 3
be put by the syllogistic method of the schoolmen , but even
to be quite definitely expressed .
A modern writer has
‘
ji
'
i s tly observed that Plotinus is the
greatest individual thinker between Aristotle and Des
cartes .
” 1 Much in Neo—Platonism fascinated Bruno, espe
ci ally the conception of the universe as a process of produc
tion from On e who suffers no loss thereby,
2 and Plotinus
’
explanation of the lower by the higher
3 much Alexandrian
thinking became , an integral part of his own philosophy,
often transmuted and improved, however .
St Clement had declared that we cannot discern what
God is so much as what He is n ot Cusanus had taught
the same thing, and Bruno accepted the final limitation of
human reason and experience and Plotinus
’
doctrine of a
being above discursive thought, above good and evil and
beauty, and above the distinctions , within the Will, of power
and freedom and necessity. For our thought
, being dis
cursive,
is imperfect .
‘1 The Absolute produces Mind con
templ ati ng itself ;
i . e .
,
it is self-conscious ; and from Mind
proceeds the Soul of the World . This is the trinity of being,
and The On e participates in all
;
souls,
separate in space
and t ime, being present to one ~ another in the Soul ofthe
Whole.
5 The Soul of the World is not in time, but,
just as
light (which in Plotinus
’
and a lso in Bruno
’
s time was sup
posed to suffe r no loss in transmission)
passes by gradations
into darkness,
so does the Ineffable pass, without loss,
through gradations of being ; and,
even as privation of light

;
1 though even
in evil there is a rational order which issues in good .
2
Although individual souls are comprised and co-present to
one another in the Soul of the World,
they are separate in
lower spheres . Having descended from the Absolute,
they
ever tend to return to Him 3 “ who is at once thine inner
most self and thine unattainable desire .
”
Plotinus further perceived that life is no mere collection
of particles ; he makes the unextended,
individual soul
form its own body it dwells wholly in every part which it
animates for,
can a part act vitally when separated from
the whole to which it belongs !
4 The individual soul is
the cause of its own thought and action , but is determined
in its context .
5 The universe and its souls are in activity
without beginning or end ; all things being traces or
shadows ,
in vastly differing measures, of the Supernal .
Bruno maintained this doctrine of shades , vestiges,
through
out his life .
6 Like Plotinus Bruno accepted universal
animism so did every thinker of his own time ;
in fact,
the View dated from Thales .
7
“ The common mark of all Alexandrian philosophy is
that it regards divine revelation as the highest source of
knowledge .

into ecstatic Visi on of the Absolute four times, being united
with Him ; and that he (Porphyry)

mysticism to which the ninth and thirteenth centuries gave
birth . From such sources as Pico, Bruno absorbed what
these writers conceived that they knew of the lore of
Chaldea , Assyria, Persia,
India and Egypt . There was
little or no idea of the historical development of thought,
and every man dragged in each and every writer who could
be supposed to support his own convictions , and would quote
them all as of equally authoritative value . Moreover, as in
the time of Dante, natural facts and even words were held
to contain symbolic significance and to be adumbrations
and indices of truth . Bruno did , not escape from these
intellectual habits , which were uni v ersal . He drew much
mystical lore from Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa

III . RAYMOND LU LLY
In early youth Bruno began the study of one whom he
calls
“ an untutored hermit, filled with divine genius
one who,
so he thought
, builded wiser than he knew .
Raymond Lully of Minorca (
1 2 35 known as
“
the
Enlightened Doctor,
” was a contemporary of Duns Scotus ,

in them, and so to track and discover knowledge . Lully
sets down for us what he considers to be those objects of
knowledge which are indisputable and universally accepted
and acknowledged, and also the methods of procedure by
which our intelligence Operates . He then places in a
circle, called the key to discovery, nine fundamental ques
tions which may be asked . Within this circle, which may
be regarded as fixed, are five other concentric circles , which
can be made to revolve , e ach one independently of the
others , and each of these circles is divided into 9 compart
ments . By following gi ven rules of a simple character,
the
middle term of any syllogism was held to be discoverable .
For speed in working,
the circles and their compartments
were indicated by symbols . Bruno saw in this art the
germs of that complete and symbolic logic at which Lully
aimed ; a Visi on which also aroused the hope ofLeibnitz
and which occupied much attention during the last quarter
of the last century . He found it invaluable for the purposes
of artificial memory, and the first and last of his printed
works , as well as many of the volumes which lie between ,
are devoted to improvements in Lulli sm. His mastery
of the
“ Enlightened Doctor
”
proved useful to him as an
introduction to scholars and to seats of learning .
IV. CUS ANU S
C usanus
(Nicolaus Chrypffs of Cues,
1401 the
son of a fisherman on the Mosel
, became a cardinal and the
close friend of E neas Silvius (Pius II)
. On e of the most
remarkable men of his age, he was the earliest of those
speculative dogmatists who lie midway between Scholas
ti ci sm and Critical Philosophy . Bruno owed to this remark
able mind his own strongest philosophic impulse and many
DI S CI PLINE OF BOOKS 2 9
of his own views ;
1 he speaks of Cusanus as
“ divine and
“ a , great discoverer.
” 2 Cusanus, as became a bold and
independent thinker,
tried to rationaliz e theology,
and made
more than one attempt to expound the Trinity as three
abstracted aspects of God and His universe, which are one .
3
He held that sense-impressions are united in the activity
of thought ; yet knowledge at its best and highest is merely
an image of being ; and therefore can only approximate
towards , and can never be identical with Reality. At best,
knowledge is as the polygon , which , while it remains a
composite figure,
can never become a circle .
4 Cusanus
declared the relativity of all knowledge ; but, by intuition ,
men can rise above antimonies and hold contraries together
in a unity ; and when we do this we are doing,
in our
finite measure, what God does . By this doctrine of intui
tion , Cusanus saves himself from scepticism . Yet ,
though
he is content to utter O al ti tudo
” 5 and finds God in com
prehensible, he declares Him to be all things , and that He
could not be other than He is this gave rise to accusations
of pantheism . The negation of greater imperfection , says
Cusanus,
is nearer truth than is the negation of the higher
attributes . In other words there are degrees in truth and
reality .
6 The universe is the unfolding of what
,
in Deity,
is unity ;
just as a li ne i s the unfolding of a point . Ifwe
reflect, we shall find that to a true maximum nothing can

away man can perceive therefore that,
in Ultimate R eality,
maximum and minimum coincide .
1 The universe is bound
less i n space and time,
and the centre of the universe is
precisely where the observer stands in it, a doctrine to
which Bruno was much indebted . Nature is animate and
articulated everything being a more or less imperfect mirror
of the uni verse in its own place, and preserving itself in
relation to and community with other things .
2
In conscious
ex perience there is indivisible continuity ; but in things
there is an in divisible mi ni mum .
3 All these views of
Cusanus reappear i n Bruno, often enlarged and enriched .
Cusanus

strengthened Bruno
’
s Pythagorean tendency . The German
saw that the u niverse can , at least in part, be ex plained
scientifically by the application of mathematics to the
results of observation ; and Bruno i s his eager pupil . It
was probably the st udy of Cus anus which set him on the
track of the infinity of the uni verse of innumerable worlds
and of the interpenetration of everything in the whole .
5
There was as yet no really philosophical or scientific
method : only an eager questioning of ex perience ; but
Cusanus made the first attempt since the days of Greek
science to ex plain the uni verse on scientific principles .
He foreshadowed the law of inertia, and declared,
in 1436,
that the earth is in motion ;

point from which
,
to observe this,
its movement cannot be
measured .
The mysticism of his countryman Eckhardt reappeared in
Cusanus ,
1 and reinforced Bruno
’
s own mystical tendency .
V. COPERNICU S AND LATER THI NKERS
Not a century after Cusanus ,
in 1 543, Nicolaus Coper
micus (
1473
—1 543)
ex pounded the theory that the earth
revolves round the sun ,
though he did not extend his con
elusions, which he drew from mathematical considerations
to the sidereal heavens . Bruno got hold of Copernicus
work .
2 Probably it was in the monastic library ;
for it
had been dedicated to Paul III at the entreaty of friends
who feared what might otherwise follow, and one Os i an d er,
a priest ofNuremberg, wrote a preface,
in whi ch ' he protests
that the work is not presented as truth , but because it
furnishes -
improved practical utility for astronomical com
putation .
3 Bruno knew that this mendaci ous apology for
speaking the truth was not written by Copernicus, who
had asserted his r ight to deal with the problem in his own
way .
4 The thoughtful pondered over Copernicus
’
book,
perceiving that he had applied Ockham
’
s raz or and dealt a
blow to the bad method of multiplying hypotheses to explain
observed facts of the same kind .
. I t was irrational to
suppose that
fNatIIre does not proceed straight to
“
her goal .
The new theory administered a shock to the fashionable
Aristotelian physics and cosmogony, built on sense-per
c eption s ,
’
and,
in time,
it came to be heartily accepted and
extended by Bruno, who had so early begun to doubt the

deliverances of sensation . There was general resistance
to the new view . Those with the spirit of the Renaissance
in them felt that a blow was struck at their exaltation of
humanity ;
the pious opined that the fall of the official
science of the Church might bring down much more . For
Bruno ,
the vivid and realistic pictures of Dante were re
placed by another kind ofrealism, colder perhaps , but only
colder to the unimaginative , appealing less, perhaps,
to ordi
nary human sympathy, but far more powerfully to intel
lectual vision . He was prepared to trust Reason and
follow her whithersoever she might lead and he saw that
,
if the importance Of man
'
as a being was diminished, his
intellect
, which could hold the whole solar system in its
grasp , gained infinitely in dignity .
Bruno read
“ The Nature of Things, by Bernardino
Telesio (
1 509 Local patriotism would prepare him
to appreciate the writings of a man who, born at Coz en a ,
had founded the Cosentina Academy at Naples . Telesio
insisted on the importance of observation and took for his
motto ,
“ not by reason , but
‘
by sense .
” But he admitted
that the mind co-operates with sensation .
1 Bruno calls
him “ the most judicious Telesio .
” 2 Girolamo Cardano
(
1 50 1 — 1 576) was another writer whom Bruno valued for
his appreciation of physical enquiry . He used much super
s ti tiou s information which can be traced to Cardano, or
to the writings of that half-mad genius in motley, Aureol
The0phras t Paracelsus (
1490 Paracelsus attracted
Bruno because of his attempt to determine the chemical
constitution of things because he held all creatures to be
emanations from a world-soul
,
3 and because he taught a
doctrine deduced from this ,
that throughout the whole choir

of heaven and furniture of earth there . exists a subtle
sympathy. Although Pietro Angelo Man z oli
(Pali n gen i us )
held the universe to be infinite, he did not produce much
effect on Bruno . Indeed,
it seems doubtful whether Bruno
ever read this Ferrarese poet, for he speaks of him as being
a German .
1
Bruno was vastly interested in the mathematics of his
day, and,
later, gave the subject much thought and evinced
considerable originality in
“
it, sometimes of a mistaken kind .
2
Indeed,
like Bacon he had taken all knowledge to be his
province .
’ Most of his acquisitions must have been made
during the quiet years at Naples . Henceforth he was a
wanderer, earni ng his bread ; and what small leisure befell
him was given up to creative work .

WANDERINGS THROUGH ITALY. NAPLES TO GENEVA
(
1 5 76—
79)
IT was a common thing in those days for monks to wander
from district to district and even from country to country .
By this means the individual monk was enabled to see men
and cities and enlarge his mind, while,
at the same time, he
got exercise and improved his health ;
the monastic com
munity,
too , benefited by interchange of ideas and was
enlivened by news from the outer world . The doors ofa
monastery were always kept wide open to a wandering
brother of the order so Bruno, escaped from Naples, would
find no difficulty in obtaini ng hospitality . He boldly claimed
it at the actual headquarters of his order . The church of
Santa Maria sopra Minerva stands on the site of a ruined
temple, opposite another which has only been robbed of its
gilded tiles and its gods : it and its famous monastery con
front the yet more famous temple of Agrippa .
He was not left there long in peace .
“ I learned, he
says ,
“ that
,
after I left Naples, certain works of St
Chrysostom and St Jerome containing the forbidden annota
tions of Erasmus, which I had secretly used and thrown into
the privy when I came away to prevent their being found,
were discovered .
” 1
Erasmus had
“ laid the egg of the Reformation in

afterwards Archbishop of York,
extracted twenty-one heretical opinions from his writings .

Bruno was concerned in some
“ taking off”
so common in
Italy, and especially common in Southern Italy,
in those
days . But ,
if so , how did it affect Giordano Was it con
n ec ted with the citation for heresy ! Was there danger of
vendetta Was there influence at work , or something con
n ec ted with the case which would fatally weight the minds
of Bruno
’
s su periors ! It is an inviting puz z le ; but the
data are imperfect ; and ingenious and plausi ble hypo
theses are nearly always exploded on the discovery of fresh
facts .
He contrived to get away from the gathering storm .
He cast his monkish gar b aside , resumed his baptismal
n ame of Philip and was no longer known as Jord an u s
while he remained in Italy .
1 He made his way over the
three hundred miles or more which lay between Rome and
the Republic of Genoa, where bloody faction-fights and
the
~
long struggle of the various classes of the city for
mastery still prevailed . The Genoese,whom Dante denounced
as barbarians,
2 were ever more famous for their quarrels
and commercial enterprise than for their encouragement of
learning, and there was little inducement to a scholar to
remain in that unquie t city . He observed one thi ng with
scornful amusement : it so struck him that he refers to it
twice .
3 “ At Genoa I saw the monks of [

St Januarius, which still continues to take place four times
yearly, and we shall find him ready to accept strange things
as due to natural causes, not yet explained . But this
base, mercenary fraud was too much for his credulity : it
symboliz ed the a si ni ty he despised .
On the Riviera Ponente, between thirty and forty miles
from Genoa,
lies Noli . It is a quaint
, ancient little coast
town , at the head of a rocky gulf, embosomed in vineyards
and backed by picturesque mountains which almost encircle
it and are close beyond its high walls . It was then a
prosperous little place, governing itself under the protection
of the Genoese Republic .
“ Here,
”
says Bruno,
“ I sup
ported myself during four or fiv e months by teaching
grammar to children
1 and the sphere to certain men of
condition .
” 2 The subject of Astronomy was then called
“ The Sphere, because the earth was supposed t o be the
central kernel of a series of transparent spheres ,
enclosing
the sun ,
“
moon , planets and fixed stars— spneres for the
metaphysical reason that the circle is the perfect figure .
These S pheres were supp
osed to revolve round the earth
with uniform motion, because that is the most perfect rate
of velocity. Such questions as the exact situation of
heaven and the precise nature of the div ine ideas embodied
in the skies were included in teaching
“ The Sphere .
”
It
was a popular subject for writing about and lecturing on ,
and ladies as well as men read papers on it at the literary
clubs— the Italian
“ Academies .
” Probably Bruno taught
these gentlemen of condition more concerning
“ The
Sphere
”
than was expected from him .
For reasons which he does not give, he turned back a
few miles to Savona,
the former rival of Genoa, and,
even
then , a busy port . It probably provided Bruno with little
more than pleasant prospects amid gardens of orange and

lemon trees ;
for, at the end of fifteen days, he made for
Turin ,
the capital of Piedmont .
1 There is a curious story
that a fourth process against the fugitive monk was issued
at Vercelli by the Genoese Republic
2 The statement is
far from inconceivable, but it comes from a suspected
source ;
it is said to have been derived from the sentence
of the Inquisition, a document which was non -producible at
the time the assertion was made .
3
Turin. was then under Filiberto Emmanuele, one of the
most enlightened monarchs of a line which , during ten
centuries, has proved itself the astutest of the ruling houses
of Europe . The reigning duke fostered both science and
literature, and, a few years before, had reconstituted the
University, making it one of the first in Italy. No town in
Europe is built on so regular a plan as Turin is : Bruno
found it a city of delight,
‘1 “ but, getting no satisfactory
sustenance there,

least, still unflaked and unfaded, and the canals below re

we read : Whilst there,
in order to furni sh me with a few
pieces to live on ,
I got a book printed, entitled
‘ The Signs

But I shewed it first to the Revd . Father
Master Remigio of Florence,
” 1 a monk of Bruno
’
s own
order, who had gained distinction because of his learning
and his version of the Psalms .
2
Probably Bruno now made up his mind to try for better
fortune in France, where Italians were well received and
Italian influence was paramount . He continues Leaving
Venice, I went on to Padua, where I found some Dominican
fathers of my acquaintance . They persuaded me to wear
my habit again ,
showing me that it was more convenient to
travel with than without it . With this idea in my mind,
I
went to Bergamo and had a robe made of cheap white cloth ,
and ov er
"
this I wore the scapular which I kept with me
when I left Rome .
” 3
It was common enough for monks to
doff the h abit and don the gayest attire ; but they were
bound to retain the scapular : to cast this aside wa S
'
re
garded as a very serious offence .
On the road to Bergamo, while resting a t Brescia, he
seems to have found a monk shut up because he had given
way to a pr0pheti c impulse : the poor brother thought him

Bruno made his way over the snows of Mont Cenis with
the intention of trying his fortune at Lyons . At the end
of the long, deep ,
i nhospitable valley along which the mule
track wound above the rushing waters of the Arc , he came
to an inviting, fertile region , where, built beside two rivers
and between two hills ,
lay the capital of Savoy. A
Dominican monastery was built at Chambéry thirty years
before; but he found no very kindly reception thereat .
He complained to an Italian monk who chanced to be
there at the time and who replied, I forewarn you that
you will get
'
uo civility in these parts , and,
the farther you
go,
the less you will find of i t .

decided to leave the route for Lyons and take the one
to Geneva .

AT GENEVA, LYONS AND TOU LOUS E
FOR three years Bruno
‘
had sojourned in various Italian
States ,
receiving hospitality in spacious , dignified monas
teri es or under the homelier shelter of some kindly Italian
roof. Nowhere were the refinements of life wanting .
Across the mountains , he found a stern ,
rough folk , who
knew not the use of the fork or the amenities of the table .
The guest at the inn was called upon to share his bed
with more than one bedfellow, and might consider himself
fortunate if he arrived at the inflexible hour for the common
meal , and
‘
had neither to forfeit it nor to tarry for it .
At Naples , Bruno read St Augustine in secret,
so we
may suppose that he felt some interest in his writings .
The austere and naked theology of‘
that Father had been
strengthened and hardened by John Calvin . That remark
able fugitive from France to Geneva had carried with him
even more of the vigour of the legislator than of the
dexterity of the
-controversialist . Conscientious in his
rejection of a mediating priesthood , he nonetheless was
visited by no scruples when he established at Geneva that
worst of theocratic governments— the tyranny of a board
of theologians . His sectaries established and maintained
the outward form of a
“ city of God,
”
less accomplished ,
less broad-mi nded , and even more coercive than ever
Rome was ; and, when Calvin died, his mantle fell on
a man of like mind— his fellow-exile, Theodore de Béz e
of Vez elay . Hardly more than twenty years before

gates to those who sought refuge for conscience-sake
and that independent thinkers from his own beloved Italy
had found asylum and established an Italian evangelical
church there . It dated from 1 54 2 . Bruno put up at a
hostelry and inscribed his name at the Academy . On e
may still read in the Rector
’
s Register the name P nilippus

The presence of a wandering monk would excite little
surprise in most places . It was quite usual to encounter
such travellers , who might wish to visit libraries , or who
found the atmosphere of their monastery uncongenial .
But a monk in this abode of the saintly elect could not
fail to attract attention although Catholic princes some
times passed through the city and even visited the most
distinguished of the exiles ,
the Neapolitan Galeaz z o
Caracciolo , marquis of Vico and nephew of Pope Paul IV.
Di Vico had forsaken wife and children for faith
’
s sake
and had been regarded by Calvin as a pillar of the church .

them and their doctrines .
” 1
But, on his arrival at Geneva , before he knew much about
Calvinistic administration , he may have flirted with the idea
of joining the Reformed Church . John Vincent told Cotin
(
if the diarist were he),
rather more than six years later ,
that
“ Jord an us said [
to the Genevese] he would have
attached himself to their religion had they not so dishonoured
him .
” 2 Probably Vincent got this on hearsay ; but it is
likely to be true . We shall deal with the
“ dishonour
”
directly . Bruno did not vex himself overmuch with the
vain disputes of theology . He conceived it to be his busi
ness to try to get at the tru th ~ of Nature by reason ,
and he confessed to his judges that h e was no theological
expert .
3 But theology can be undermined by philosophy
and physical science . Bruno
’
s intrepid z eal for truth landed
him in difficulties when little more than two months had
elapsed from his arrival in Geneva . On e of the evangelical
shepherds of the city was Antoine de la Faye of Chateaudun ,
a man who had taken his medical degree at Padua five years
before and was a refugee .
4 Most likely Aristotle was the
subject of dispute . How long Bruno continued to accept
the authority of Aristotle , we do not know ; but he came
after much thought to perceive the errors of his Cosmology
and Pli y s i cs .
5 Ever a fighter, a valiant knight-errant of
Truth, he was as impulsive and imprudent as courageous .
Rebellion against accepted views i s always strangely limited
in its extent, and the governing body of the Genevese

reformers retained not a few of the prejudices of their fore
fathers ;
they regarded Aristotle as hardly less authoritative
than
’
Holy Writ Th
‘
eodore de Béz e told Pierre de la
Ramée that they had resolved not to depart one jot or tittle
from the judgements of Aristotle ; and amongthose who
supported this decision was de la Faye, who ,
just now, was
lecturing at the Academy on Philosophy .
If, as a passage in Genevese records would seem to indi
cate,
it was on Aristotle t hat Bruno attacked de la Faye,
he began a warfare at Geneva which occupied the best
years of a reb
’
ellious life— a determined and persistent effort
to upheave the dead load of obsolete authority and give
freedom to the human spirit once again . He felt,
to use the
language of Bacon ,
that the ancient cosmology was
“ no
match for the subtlety of Nature .
” 1
The co
r
n s i s tory of theologians sat watchful for the slightest
offence against the stringent moral and theological code
they chose to institute .
2 On Thursday, August 6,
I 579, we
find Bruno and one Jean Bergeon laid by the heels . It is
recorded in the Registers of the Consistory that Bruno had
caused Bergeon to print certain objections and invectives
agai n t M. de la Faye ,
reckoning twenty blunders in one of
his lectures .
’
(The twenty blunders became multiplied by
five i n Parisian gossip .
3
)
It was resolved that he should
be examined after dinner . Then Jean Bergeon pleaded
that the Italian had persuaded him of the wholly philoso
phi c al bearing of the matter he was given a day
’
s imprison
ment and fined 50 flori n s .
The next day Bergeon sent up a petition asking the Council
to pardon his transgression . He had been led astray by
the monk, who affirmed there was nothing in it against God

or the Council . His fine was reduced by half,
on account
of his small mean
‘
s . Bruno seems to have been visited in
his cell by the pastors and one Michael Varro, a lawyer who
dabbled in mathematics and natural science and had written
on motion . The lawyer
'
s hobby strengthens the surmise
that the quarrel arose about Aristotle . Bruno acknowledged
that he had offended . The council sat again on Monday,
l oth Aug.
, and decided that he should be set free, but he
must beg pardon of God,
the law and the insulted professor ;
he must acknowledge his Offence before the Consistory and
tear up the libel . So , on the 1 3th August he appeared ,
as
required, before the Consistory to acknowledge his trans
gre S S IOn i n that he had erred in doctrine and called the
pastors of the Church of Geneva pedagogues .
” But a sur
prise awaited the good pastors : he would
“ neither excuse
himself nor plead guilty,
for the matter had not been truly
reported . He believed the story came from Pastor Antoine .
de la Faye . Asked whom he called pedagogues, he made
many excuses and assertions that he was persecuted,
set
ting forth conjectures and fresh accusations, but nevertheless
admitted he was here to own his misconduct in t raducing the
pastors . Was admonished to follow the true doctrine . Said
he was ready to receive censure . Seeing that he calumniated
the said de la
‘Faye,
and accused him of saying a thing which
he did not say, and had no wish to repent his doings, but
urged that
“
he had done right,
it is recommended that he
shall make a complete apology and acknowledge his trans
gre s si on otherwise,
that he be forbidden the sacrament and
be brought up again before the governing board , who are
entreated not to endure this kind of person , one who disturbs
the school
, and who shall straightwaybe compelled to acknow
ledge his offence . Replied,
that he repented of his offence,
would amend his speech , and, further, admitted having
calumniated Pastor de la Faye . The said remonstrances
AT GENEVA, LYONS AND TOU LOU S E 47
and prohibition of the sacrament made, and he sent away
remonstrating .
” On Thursday, Aug. 2 7,
“ Philippe Brun ,
student
,
residing in this city, begs for the sacrament
, which
had been forbidden him, acknowledging that he had
greatly offended . It was decided that he should be thoroughly
reprimanded and allowed to partake of the sacrament . The
said reprimand to free him from his transgression ; for
which he humbly rendered thanks .
” 1
These entries in the Genevese Register would seem,
at first sight,
to prove that Bruno conformed to a regulation
of the Ci ty whereby students were compelled to sign the
Calvinistic Confession of faith . It has been shown ,
however,
that this regulation ,
framed in 1 5 59,
ceased to
be enforced in 1 576 . After the latter date, only member
ship ofthe community was required ; and Bruno fulfilled
this condition by putting in an appearance at the Italian
Evangelical Church . The sentence of exclusion from the
sacraments would appear to have been merely a formal
one— one that we find repeated at Helmstadt a few
years later On a similar occasion . It does not necessarily
imply that Bruno was ever a communicant . But it would
carry with
»
i t the stigma of heresy and be productive of
highly inconvenient,
if not serious, consequences , When
on trial for his life he gave an open and manly account
of his career and Opinions . It is true that here and there
he slides over a fact capable of being turned against him ;
now and then he puts a
'
little theological whitewash , as
the times required, on his Opinions . But any unprejudiced
reader must regard his statement,
taken as a whole, as
being a model of plain, straightforward statement . In it we
find him saying :
“ I often went to hear heretics preach or
dispute [
in Protestant countries] rather through curiosity

as to their ways than because I found them inviting ;
nor
had I satisfaction ;
so that after the reading or sermon ,
when the time came for the sacrament and the distribution
of bread in their style, I went about my business . I have
never taken the sacrament or observed their practices .
”
The inquisitors pointed out that the statement was hardly
credible, since by non-compliance he would make enemies .
Bruno replied :
“ Wherein I have transgressed I have told
the truth . Herein I did not sin , and it shall never be
found of me . Moreover,
in these heretical lands Catholics
are alway s to be met with who do not observe their
usages .
” 1 An d the Parisian diarist writes :
“ John Vincent
says that Jordan u s paid penalty on his knees at Geneva
for calumniating M. de la Faye, a doctor of medicine of
Padua ,
and printi ng a sheet containing 1 00 (
sic)
blunders
committed by La Faye in a single lesson . Then Jord anus
said he would have attached himself to their religion had
they not so dishonoured him . The said de la Faye is
preaching at the present time .
” 2
Bruno had been kindly received by the Italian reformers
at Geneva ; he had been ill-treated by his own Church ;
he had achieved by this time his own esoteric interpretation
of Christianity, and he would gladly have united himself
with a truly liberal Church . Indeed one could hardly get
daily bread on any other terms than that of joi ni ng the
dominant Church of a place , Roman or Protestant . As to
the sacrament,
that would present no insuperable difficulty
were he once sure of the sincerity and libefal wisdom of the
religious community administering it . He did not dabble
in theological niceties . Peter and Paul

knowledge of subtleties ;
they only knew that
“ this is my
body
”
; and, while he accepted the Catholic doctrine of
transubstantiation , he gave it an interpretation of his own
the whole universe ,
in his philosophy,
is an eternal trans
mutation of the World-Soul
,
the Divine Word,
the ever
present Absolute . He laughed at the fuss that men made
about
“ mysteries of Ceres and Bacchus .
” 1 Bruno was
not the man to submit to the narrow yoke of acrid
Calvinism . But the ecclesiastical despotism of Geneva
had prohibited the sacrament , and he was sent away
remonstrating, not against the formal sentence , but against
what it implied . He had to request that it should be
withdrawn , probably because there would otherwise be
no sustenance for him forthcoming either from the printers
or from the incensed Italian Community. Henceforward
he had no leanings towards Calvinism .
Once, on the occasion of some meticulous theologic tiff,
Calvin himself was exiled with the polite intimation that
“ the gates of the city were open .
” They were still un
closed to dissentients .
“ Having been told,
”
says Bruno ,
“ that I could n ot stay if I did not bring my mind to accept
the religion of that city, and , besides , having received no
aid from them,
I determined to leave, and I journeyed to
Lyons , where I stayed a month ; but not finding the where
withal for my daily bread and necessities ,
I went on to
Toulouse .
” 2
There was an

chiefly ofemigrants
fromLucCa . There were also several famous printing-presses,
which turned out more books every year than Paris could
boast of. Such men as Doletus , Henricus Stephanus

and Servetus had earned their living there by reading
proofs .
1 So Bruno had good reason to hope for the
success he failed to obtain there .
Toulouse was a bulwark of orthodoxy and one of the
most intolerant cities in France . The university boasted
its students , most of them following the law-courses ,
for which Toulouse had acquired particular fame . Petrarch
had studied law there, and there Lully had taught .
The Dominicans had a monastery in the city, wherein ,
lay the bones of Aquinas ; but we may be sure that Bruno
did not seek hospitality at a place which ,
for the memories
it aroused , presented so much of interest to him . That
easy charm of the children of the south ,
so attractive and
ingratiating, must have been his, for here, as in every new
place throughout his life, he speedily made acquaintances .
He began to enjoy brighter days than had fallen to his lot
during the past three years . He was asked to
“ read the
Sphere with certai n students ,
” 2 and continued to do this
and teach philosophy for about six months .
His sympathies were with the concrete organic life of
Catholicism, and not at all with the atomic individualism
of the Protestants and that tendency towa rds social and
moral disruption which was a lready apparent among them .
Geneva had cured him of all illusion on that score . Until
he was seiz ed by the Officers of the Inquisition , he could
never understand that the belief of the Roman Church
was ex pressed in other than
“ language of accommodation ,
and that truly inst ructed and wise Catholics would prefer
rigid and incomprehensible dogma to his own esoteric and
rationaliz ed explanation . Bruno felt as might an ancient
Greek exile, a homeless wanderer fromhis own city, which
meant more than home to him,
and deprived of the civic

and it is easy to see how it arose . The diarist gives clear
evidence that he did not catch or remember everything
Bruno told him, and it was Bruno
'
s habit to call him
self a
“ doctor in Roman theology
1 “ The theses for his
doctorate,
”
the diarist continues, were
‘Whatever St
Thomas says in his summary against the Gentiles is true
and Whatever the Master of Sentences (St Peter Lombard)
‘
says is true .
’ He ranks St Thomas above all in his
Summa and Disputed Questions .
’” 2
Armed with his degree, Bruno entered into the contest
for the chair . In those day
s, as still for the Rectorship
of our Scottish Universities ,
the election lay with the
students : it had done so from the first beginnings of
Universities . He must have got a considerable reputation
through his private lessons ,
for the choice fell on him .
“ I
presented myself to the meeting and was appointed and
approved, and gave instruction on Aristotle
’
s De An ima
and other philosophical subjects .
” 3 This text-book would
give him an opportunity of treating a popular subject in
his own original way. The nature and destiny of the soul
had been eagerly debated for a century, with all the i n ev i t
able rancour and vituperation which attend on disputation
without real knowledge . Probably the new professor,
whose z eal and courage,
in the end, always got the better
of his modicum of tact
,
contrived to arouse bitter opposition .
He could hardly have avoided expounding the germs of
the philosophy which was shaping itself in his mind ; and
there was plenty to offend therein . In the MS . of his
evidence at the Venetian trial
, a passage which runs :
“ But
in certain disputable points which I gave forth , and proposed

conclusions is cancelled .
1 This points to some
opposition and elsewhere Bruno wrote of the rowdy bear
ing of studentstowards him at Toulouse , Paris and Oxford .
2
At the two last named universi ties, we know that his attacks
on Aristotle aroused violent resentment . Little freedom of
thought was allowed at Toulouse in days when France was
distracted by faction and Catholics and Huguenots were at
each other
’
s throats . During the year which saw Bruno
’
s
arrival in the city and the first complete year of his stay
there (
1 579
—80)
the Huguenots made more than forty attacks
on neighbouring towns .
The passage referring to disputes in the school having
been cancelled , Bruno continues :
“ I left on account of the
civil wars, and went on to Paris .
” 3 A very excellent
reason ; but did it s tand alone
He would seem to have employed his time at Toulouse,
when he was not teaching,
in writing a big book on Lullian
method a nd artificial memory which he entitled
“ Clavis
Magna
” “ The Great Key .
” He conceived that he had
included and systematiz ed in it all the theories and practical
devices ofprevious writers on these subjects and this in a
complete philosophic form . The work was never published,
although Bruno frequently refers to it in his earlier writings
but there is little doubt that parts of it were the bases of
his Seal of Seals

THERE was relative peace in France . The seventh of a
series of monstrous wars had been ended by a patched-U p
agreement . Wrecked cities and unpeopled villages, burnt
farms and fields laid waste bore witness everywhere to the
fury of faction and the malevolent rancour of Opponents
who disguised personal hatred under the convenient mask
of religion . From the disappearance of tolerant classic
paganism,
the unformulated aspirations or discontent of
races and classes found in this or that religious creed a
suitable rallying cry ; and now the opposed forces which
made for liberty on the one hand and for the compact
state on the other set up their separate religious banners .
'All the scoundrels in France gathered round the one or
the other of these ;
they dub bed themselves Catholic or
Huguenot
;
all
,
that was atavistic in human nature was
aroused,
and all the vilest and most primitive passions were
set loose . , Pick me out,
” wrote Montaigne, pick me out
from the Catholic army a ll the men who are actuated either
by a pure z eal for religion or by loyalty to their country
and you will not find enough to form one single company .
Everywhere poverty, hunger,
suffering and disease were
the result of these Wars . Bruno journeyed to Paris through
provinces marked by scath and bale . All the way,
to use
the words of Castelnau , was
“ one long bleeding wound .
”
Bruno crystalliz es his experience in three significant phrases
the French uproar,
” “ the French fury and
“ the bloody
54
F I RS T S TAY IN PARI S 5 5
Seine
” 1 The best of the sons of France, men of broad
mind and dignified character, brilliant scholars and original
thinkers had , for the most part, been slaughtered or exiled .
Montaigne retired to the remote home of his ancestors ; he
speaks of it as the only chateau in France which had no
guard or sentinel but the stars .
”
The Gallic fury, which had been let loose on Italy and
brought ruin there, was now expending itself at home .
Yet the i nvaders brought back a novel appreciation of
letters and refinement, coupled with a far greater a ppreci a
tion of luxury . When the descendan t of Florentine pawn
brokers became the mother of French kings, fashion aped
the superior civiliz ation of Italy ; and in this way Italy
came to exercise an enduring influence on the quick aptitude
of France . The slaughter of St Bartholomew
’
s day had not
wholly extinguished the torch of the
'
Renaissance which
French hands had snatched up : it still burned brightly in
literature and art ; and Frenchmen shewed their innate
geni us for history, memoirs and the essay . Montaigne had
just published the first two books of his immortal work .
A group of French humanists,
although unpossessed by
passion an d unendowed with originality, had aimed at a
ri ch
'
v oc abulary and a splendid style . They took
'
the later
Italian literature as their example, and although stricken
in years , most of them were still living . French artists
and architects still imitated Italian models , breathing into
their copies a grace and refinement which is peculiarly
Gallic . At Court
,
the Queen Mother and her Italian
followers were copied with such absurd detail as changed
permanently the very pronunciation of the language ;
the
French 0 was flattened by fashion into a . In spite of the
terrible and protracted strife throughout the land, all
manner of Italians from each little State came pouring over

the mountains to find their El Dorado at the French Court
or in French cities ; and ,
for the most part
,
they were
cordially welcomed .
Paris was chiefly a mass of miserable hovels . The
luxury of the Court contrasted strangely with the squalor
of the streets ;
the ignorant noble,
caring for nothing but
warfare, horsemanship and sport
,
1 was a figure which
implied the x fami shed beggar. Even the priests besought
alms as they paraded the streets with Open missal .
2 Yet
Italian traders did well . Italian astrologers and actors,
teachers of horsemanship and fencing-masters , doctors and
scholars found a temporary or permanent home in France .
The pulpits were filled by Italian preachers and eager
ears drank in draughts of eloquence in Italianised French .
Italian professors were appointed to vacant chairs at the
seats of learning . Small wonder that Bruno cast his eyes
on Paris !
Moreover,
the University, although she was no longer
mistress of theologic thought and arbitress in Philosophy,
and her schools were now badly attended, maintain
’
ed some
measure of her ancient prestige .
Furnished with his degree, Bruno , whom we find calling
himself by his monkish name Giordano again, arrived in
Paris towards the end of 1 5 8 1 . It was a common thing
for scholars to wander from place to place and fight their
way into office by securing popularity or influence . He
says :
“ When I wen t to Paris,
in order to get me known
and my measure taken ,
I gave thirty ex positions of the
Thirty Divine Attributes ,
taken from the first part of [
the
Summa Theologi a of]St Thomas
3
I have a l
ways admired Catholic theologians, particularly S t Thomas,
whose works I have always kept at hand, perused and

praised . I have them still and hold them dear .
” 1 The
Angelic Doctor, as the accepted exponent of Catholic
philosophy, was no less highly rated by the professors and
students of Paris . Humanism had never taken deep root
in the University, and , after the massacre of 1 572 , true
scholars hip languished and Catholic studies triumphed .
What choice of subject could have been a happier one !
Bruno
’
s disquisitions were so successful that he remained
in Paris,
lecturing on mnemonics and the art of Lully as
improved by himself,
throwing into it the germs of his own
philOS Ophi c views . He was a stimulating teacher, full of
fire and originality . He would dictate with great rapidity,
standing on one leg as he did so . He could be persuasive
and convincing : often he became provocative and tactless .
His pupils say that he was marvellously ready of thought
and speech ; he could deal with any subject that turned
up ; he often employed a barbarous Latin jargon , but
became truly eloquent at times he would carry his hearers
away with him and his lecture room was packed .

able to accept an ordinary professoriate,

Univ ersity of Toulouse,
that of P aris made attendance at

says Bruno,
I always avoided
doing, having left my order and cast offmy habit . I
continued my teaching .
” His reputation reached the Court .
“ I got me such a name that King Henry III summoned
me one day to discover from me if the memory which I
possessed was natural or acquired by magic art . I satisfied
him that it did not come from sorcery but from organised

royal patron was of a singular and difficult
disposition . He had received the fatal inheritance of a
neurotic and unstable temperament ; he was quick to
imitate and quick to change . His susceptible mind had
received some cultivation ; but his nurture was even more
unfortunate for one of such unbalanced disposition than is
usual with the ordinary prince : he was brought up in a
sty of luxury and encouraged to let , himself go to each
momentary impulse . Tasso believed that Henry
’
s character
was injured in critical years by the dissipations which were
forced on hi m during his 5 0journ in Italy.
4 His contem
porari es maintained that he was sound at heart
, but vacilla
ting, a man of whims ,
subject to the allurements of the
moment and the seductions of his companions . On e day
he would parade in the street as a penitent another day
he would don female garb and enact the painted harlot at
a banquet, graced by the sanctioning presence ofthe Queen
Mother . He filled his Court with loose women and scan
d alous youths . Often well-intentioned, his favour could
not be depended on,
for he frequently became irresolute,
incapable and indolent . He left affairs of state to others
in order to fondle lap-dogs . So nervous that a thunder
storm would frighten him into the cellars of his palace, he

regarded as a sacred temple of protection and liberality, a
sanctuary for learning and a source of honour and power ;
the Court ,
too, was the school of manners,
the patron of
scholarship, science and the arts all hope of the advance
ment of letters rested on princes and nobles ;
the very
means of livelihood might depend on their favour ;
the
Court was the avenue to success . An d, even in our own
simple-minded and undesigning days,
it is not every one
who shall be so downright as was the Ettrick shepherd
and address an antagonist as
“ damned sir
”
or subscribe
himself yours disgusted .
”
But Bruno, although he fell in with the courtly fashion of
the time,
felt real gratitude to Henry, and there is nothing
servile in his tone ; he lauds the King, but he is also con
scious of his own worth and asserts it . In the sentence
wherein Henry is addressed as famous and magnanimous
he is informed that the work presented to him is among
the greatest
; noble as to its subject and remarkable in its
concoction .
” And Bruno
’
s gratitude was exceptional in
being no mere p assing flush of feeling . When away in
England , he extolled Henry,
1 and later,
in Southern Ger
many, when Henry had incurred the reproach ofall Europe,
Bruno had a work printed in which he allowed a laudatory
preface, written in Paris,
to stand .
2
It has been considered uncertain whether the
“ Extra
ordinary Lectureship with a salary,
” which the King gave
Bruno, was at the Sorbonne or at the College de Cambra i
,
an institution which bore several names and is generally
known as the College de Fra n ce.
3
I have, however,
little
doubt that he was appointed to the latter college, and think

so because, first
, although founded in 1 348 ,
it was remodelled
and endowed by Francis II and remained fostered and pro
tected by the Throne . Secondly,
it was a modern school
,
Opposed to the teaching of the ignorant Sorbonne, which
had pronounced
“ Greek, Hebrew and elegant Latin to be
the language of heretics
”
and directed its attention to more
Catholic studies . As more liberal than the Sorbonne,
the
College of Cambrai was less unsuited to the highly un con
v en tion al teaching of Bruno , and , although both establish
ments
‘
now slavishly followed Aristotle, not long before,
it
was at the Cambrai that the would be subverter of his
logic, Pierre de la Ramée (Ramus)
delivered his lectures .
1
Thirdly, Besler, who acted as one of Bruno
’
s copyists, wrote
after the title of one of his works a treatise by Giordano
Bruno, verily the living sap of the Cambrai
,
” 2 and Bruno
himself calls a work, published in 1 5 8 8 ,
the Acroti smus
of Jord an us Brun us of the Cambrai .
” 3 Fourthly,
two of
his works ,
that dedicated to the King and one dedicated to
the Venetian Ambassador at Paris , were printed in the
immediate neighbourhood of the College of Cambrai
, as is
set forth on their title-pages.
4 Again , on his second visit to
Paris (
1 5 8 5 ) Bruno was partly supported by friends and
dwelt with them,
5 and the diarist already quoted notes that

he lodges near the College of Cambrai .
” 1
It is unlikely that
he then held any chair , or he would not have re quifed such
aid , and the fact that his friends lived close to the College
points to that as the one where he had held a post . More
over,
the famous disputation ,
to which we shall come in due
course, was held at the College and not at the Sorbonne .
2
It is true that the College of Cambrai was opposed to the
Jesuits, and Bruno consulted a Jesuit . But Prof. Mc In ty re
is mistaken in supposing that he did so during his first visit
to Paris .
3 He did so during hi s second stay, a t the instiga
tion of the Spanish Ambassador .
’1
Bruno was kindly received by his fellow-professors . At
first, at least, his lectures were popular,
5 and he speaks of
the attendance of learned persons both at his public and
private teaching .
6 He made the acquaintance of Re
'
gnault,
secretary to Henry of Angouleme , Grand Prior of France .
An gouléme was the bastard son of Henry II by a Scots
lady named Leviston , and ,
therefore, was half
-brother to
the King . Manuscript copies of Bruno
’
s seco nd book The
Chant of Circe
” 7 were in circulati on , and Regnault wished
his friend to get the work printed . Since Bruno was
occupied by weightier matters ,
”
i . e . the instruction of the
Ki ng, Regnault und ertook i ts production , dedicating it to
D
’An gouléme . It appeared , bound up with the
“ Shadow
of Ideas,
” Among other influential persons whom
he got to know was Giovanni Moro,
the accomplished am
bas s ador of Venice . Moro had just replaced Lorenz o Priuli
,
who was destined to preside over Bruno
'
s trial at Venice ;
so Priuli may have kn own Bruno at Paris or heard of his
reputation for heresy, which, as we shall see, was afloat .

this time a
comedy in Italian called The Chandler .

He was in the royal favour, held a royal appointment
and was not unfriended at Court . Yet all wa s not so well
with him as i t seemed . How could it be
‘ with a man who
might say with his English contemporary, My thoughts
are stitched to the stars
”
!
3
He sat apart
,
a solitary thinker , a somewhat disappointed
man . Excommunic ation debarred him from his due . We
learn how he was regarded, or regarded himself,
from
the title-page of his play : he is “ il fastidito ,
” “ the man
wi th his stomach turned .
” But he has learned to accept life
as it comes, with serene outlook and even temper ; he
declares that he is cheery when sad and sad in cheer ;
” 4
yet surely there is a sub -acid flavour in the announcement
that he is
“ an academici an of no academy
”
-he is that
strong, sad man who thinks for himself, and ,
therefore,
stands alone .
It behoved him to walk warily ; and Bruno was not a
wary person . The Catholic Reaction was triumphant in
Paris , and his printed books contained dubious doctrine . It

is hardly likely that his lectures were free from all offence .
There had been a time when Ramus and Postel attacked
Aristotle before crowded benches and it was still possible
to introduce new ideas under cover of the Stagirite
’
s mantle
but former attacks had not been made on the Aristotelian
Cosmology. Bruno had once held with Aristotle, but
Copernicus had obliged him to change his mind .
1 Aristotle,
as accepted and expounded by the schoolmen , was held to
be a pillar of Christian philosophy ;
the new science over
threw more than one foundation-stone in the teaching of the
Church , and Bruno never missed an opportunity of assailing
Aristotle on a side which was generally unquestioned .
Pundits,
too,
like poets , are an irritable folk . Scholars ,
i n
the sixteenth century, were not invariably endowed with
breadth of vision , and they were apt to grow waspish .
Students at the universities were undisciplined in manners ,
and the natural geni us of the student calls on him to seiz e
every opportunity of converting the lecture-room into a
bear-garden . Moreover,
in social intercourse, Bruno was
far from cautio us ;
2 what fermented in his brai n must out
on his tongue . In a somewhat confused manuscript record
wherein he runs, or was reported as running,
two separate
stays i n Paris together, he told the I nquisitors that he left
France for England on account of tumults which were
brewing .
3 But,
from the peace of Fleix in 1 5 80 to the
outbreak of the war of the three Henrys in 1 5 8 5 ,
there
was an almost complete lull in religious and political strife .
Bruno must have been conscious that personal trouble
loomed ahead . His scandalous doctrines got talked about .
Opinions so unhallowed shocked every kind ofChristian .

” 1 Whatever may have happened, Bruno de
parted from France bearing a letter of recommendation
from the King to Michel de Castelnau , Lord of Mauv i ss iére,
who was his Ambassador at the Court of Eliz abeth . It is
evident that Henry could be broad-minded on occasion , and
had some respect for intellectual pluck and power : it softens
one

s judgement of that egregious monarch .

THE EARLY WORKS
I . THE SHADOWS OF IDEAS
IN 1 5
8 2 , Gorbi n, whose shop was under the sign of
“ Hope,
”
produced the second of Bruno
’
s printed works ,
but the first which has been preserved down to our own
time .
“ De Umbris Id ear um
” “ The Shadows of Ideas
”
was dedicated to Henry and issued
“ with his privilege .
Now Chi cus IEs culan us asserted in his commentary “ In
S pheram
”
that Solomon wrote a work on the shadows of
ideas ,
and perhaps this statement suggested the title to
Bruno ;
for more than once he refers to Solomon and his
Song in this book .
1 The work aimed at setting before the
King, men of cultured mind,
scholars and students an im
proved art Ofrememberi ng ; but, since the mnemonic system
displayed is loosely associated with metaphysical bases,
the
latter are treated of in the first part of the book as Shadows
of Ideas
” while the second part is entitled the
“ Art of
Memory. The first part i s frankly Neo-Platonic . Bruno
had absorbed much Neo-Platonism ;
it was a popular doc
trine in his time . It is true that he despised its Italian ex
ponent
, Pico della Mirandola
2 but the symbolic doctrine of
the On e True Light approached so near to the conceptions

of things , and things are the vestiges of the Being of beings .
Throughout
, he presupposes an ultimate identity of thought
and thing ; of memory and nature ; of what is knowable
and the unknown ; offact and power . This Opinion has
been pretty generally held by the profounder thinkers . The
age was so convinced of the reality of a single principle
that it sought eagerly for the Elix ir of Life and the
Philosopher
’
s stone .
I t had been shown by the later Greeks that sense-per
c eption was not to be depended on for the discovery of
truth . The Neo-Platonists therefore relied on the directness
of intuition concerning high matters they
regarded intuition
as having the force ofperception on a higher plane . This
was also characteristic of the mystics and it greatly
influenced Bruno . But he held man to be incapable of
achieving the very truth .
1 We are but shadows of the
Ineffable On e ;
2
for the light which reaches us is confused
and contradictory and mixed with darkness ; we perceive
good and evi l together and in contrast
,
the beautiful
associated with the ugly to Which it is in opposition .
3
Looked at from the eternal point of view, all
,
even the
worst evils are perfection ; everything descends from the
]
perfect and everything strives to Wing a homeward flight .
4
The human soul is to the human body as is a pilot to the
ship : it is in it, but not of i t,
5 and, being associated with
body,
the soul perceives truth confusedly and as in flux .
But the Idea draws us on ; and,
in itself,
it is not abstract
but concrete and articulated .
7 Our ideas, we must re
member, are as an admixture of light and shadow and not
that absolute truth which they can never reach

theless the mind can rise above the things of sense, perceiv
ing unity in plurality .
1 Mystic uni on with the Divinity was
experienced by Plotinus and others .
2 From the acceptance
of this mystical ex perience thus avowed in this early work ,
Bruno never departed . But in his later Works, wherein he
reproduces far less NeO-Platonism and becomes vastly more
original
, he proclaims that by the exercise of reason also we
can attain comprehensive contact with the Absolute, Who is
at once the source and object of our search .
3
God is immanent a s well as transcendent ;
for does not
man share a measure ofthe Ineffable Light !
4 The inter
connection of ideas naturally corresponds with that of
things .
5 Bu t memory is apt to break down, and , where it
does so, we may mend it by working on the lines of its
natural operation .
5 He feels the significance of the principle
of the Association of Ideas, which Aristotle was the first to
indicate, and uses it . He also culls the best from all writers
of his time on mnemonics, as he told us in the preface he
intended to do . Our ideas being shadows of truth,
7 we use
shadows of these shadows in mnemonics . We can economiz e
thought by means of signs the nature of which is that they
are shadows or traces .
To fix attention , maintain interest and arouse emotional
force, he introduces mythological subjects .
3
Imagine What a good draw a really useful tool for
unearthing the buried treasures of the mind would be to
men who found books so hard to come at ! But Bruno was
endowed with a prodigious memory, and he falsely attributed
his natural power to the a rtifi ces he employed . Probably
the expectations he excited were not fulfilled . There is no

great novelty in his mnemonics he was one of the
“ celestial
thieves
”
of his generation . There are,
in De Umbri s ,
fore
shadowings of his philosophic syncretism but he has not
yet welded the conclusions of others into a Vital whole or
made them live anew in his own completer thought the work
is tentative and contains only the germ of the Bruno that
was presently to appear ; but such remarks as the one that
religious mysteries are mere institutions to train human
ey es zfor the perception of the steep passage from darkness
to light
”
are truly Brun i an .
He introduces symbolic verse of his own composition and
gives us brisk dialogue between Hermes, Philotimus and
Logifer, with thrusts ,
less severe than t hose which were to
follow, at the doctors and masters of the schools .
Scholars had travelled a far road from the elegant Latin o f
Cicero . Bruno
’
s Latin is full of neologisms his syntax is
had ; his prosody, abominable . I n a la ter work he acknow
ledges that hiS Latin is coarse and rough . But it is alive .
On e finds the elements of Bruno
’
s manner in this early Work
and they may be conveniently ex amined here .
He delights in brisk and varied dialogue which knows
no curb . Sometimes the thread of mystical symbolism
which runs through it finds a natural expression in metre ;
every here and there he breaks into verse, which, no less
than prose, he writes with impetuous fury . At its worst ,
one is reminded that he came from the land of i mp rovvi sa
tor i . He is far too much in a hurry to be over careful as
to style,
and never dreams of polish ;
for the thing he
has to declare is infinitely more important than the manner
of declaring it . Later, he hinted at being too diffuse,
1 but
failed to amend his ways . In his verses ,
there is little of
craftsman-like S kill . His pen flows as rapidly as his
thought
; his mind is full to bursting point ; he indulges
l
THE EARLY WORKS 7 1
i n wide circlings and side-long sweeps . He casts about
for the most unlikely allegory ;
for to him, as to Dante
and Swedenborg a nd Emerson , all nature and all the
products of the human mind are symbolic of higher truth ;
and in this he fell into line with the . conviction of his
century, percei vi ng deep analogies in fact and fable,
whether sacred or profane . Hence ,
in an age of respect
for authority, he supports an argument by drawing on his
own vast lore ; he lugs i n learning by the ears , not for
displaybut to rei nforce his meaning . He does this quite
impartially : the Bible,
the Pre-Socratic philosophers ,
the
Cabala and classic myth are introduced as of e qual wei ght .
There i s real unity underlying each of his works ; but all
give the impression of disorder . For,
each trivial occasion ,
each intruding half-thought is as a spark which he allows
to burst into vivid and vagrant flame : his imagination
plays riotously round his
‘
immedi ate theme, and then sud
d enly leaps a s ide . Sometimes this i s a trick , done of set
purpose . If the men of the Renaissance rejoiced in life,
towards the close of the peri od they expressed their vigour
in violence . Hence Bruno IOs t no opportunity of keeping
his readers awake by the oddness of his antics ; he sur
prises them by bombardments and unexpected raking fires .
He thinks to throw each noble design,
each lofty thought
into relief by the dodge (
not wholly unknown to modern
authors) of smart paradox . Prolixity and the grossly
grotesque entertained his age : they bore ours . All is
overdone : there is not a thought of repose . Penetrative
insight , soaring imagination, novel wisdom,
severe thought
have a setting of jest and jeer,
clumsy buffoonery and
sheer indecency . He was justified in being sure of
himself; but h i s bombastic self-assertion repels the modern
reader. He delights in contrast and invective . His polemic
is implacable and often unjust, but less so than that of his
7 2 GIORDANO BRUNO
contemporaries and immediate successors and he flies less
readily than they to the final argumen t of abuse . As
Tocco remarks,
1 his motive is always noble ; he “ made
no thought of life
” 2
and proved it by sacrifice and suffer
ing and sealing his faith in death .
II. THE INCANTATION OF CIRCE
Books of the period bore odd titles to catch the eye .
Bruno called his next work the Cantus Ci rcaeus
” “ The
Incantation OfCirce .
”
forms men into beasts, discusses with her handmaiden the
human vice which each kind of beast represents , and each
beast and its vice are memorised under init ial letters .
Now the nature of memory is occult
,
and the recalling of
The Homeric sorceress , who trans
ideas may be regarded as a sort of magical process . So
the art of memory may be regarded as a fascinating i n
cantation . The dialogue is full of bitter satire on human
depravity . A second dialogue follows with different inter
locUtors . It treats more directly and precisely than the
previous
“ Art of Memory of that subject . There is an
attempt to localise the functions of the brain as the
physical conditions of mental process .
3 The principle
of the association of ideas is more closely followed
‘
than in De Umbr i s and c0pi ous illustrations of method
are given . The work abounds in obscurities, which
were as attractive to superior minds in that age as in
our own . Later on Bruno found it convenient to be
occasionally obscure where it was wiser to suggest
merely to those few who had the capacity really to
understand perilous doctrine . But Bruno never erred
on the side of over-caution !

THE EARLY WORKS 73
III . THE LULLIAN ARCHITECTURE
In the same year appeared a third book ,
the
“ Brief
Architecture OfThe Art of Lully With Its Completion .
” 1
It
was published by Gorbi n and was little more than a repro
duction of Lully
’
s Great Art .
” But Bruno thought that art
a key to the structure of the universe and the ready way to
a complete philosophy, proceeding from foundations of all
knowledge he conceived of it as a demonstration of unity,
the shortest of roads for thought and memory, and a useful
symbolic logic . Of the value of Inference i n
“
extending
knowledge, Bruno had little more notion than had Lully .
For, although Lully worked Outside scholasticism and ex
hibi ted much of that spontaneous originality which we find
in Scotus Erigena before scholasticism began, mediaeval
thought was harnessed i n the syllogism and employed itself
in ceaseless rotation ,
like a donkey round a grinding mill,
but mostly grinding philosophic chaff. In Bruno
’
s time
Lully captured many able minds and had a g reat vogue .
Before Kant,
-i t was not possible to work from other than
dogmatic premises ;
certain concepts were posited as
fundamental and ultimate ;
there was no notion of sub
mitting them to criticism . For Bruno,
the art of Lully was
aliVe ;
for us,
it has become dead and valueless .
Lully tried to prove the dogmas of the Church by human
reason .
2 Bruno,
in this work, denies that they afe reason
able : any attempt to prove their, truth is a blunder ;
for
Christianity is irrational
,
contrary to philosophy and in
disagreement with other religions . We only accept it by
faith and through revelation . As a Neo-Platonist and
syncretist he relies on and quotes pagan authority as freely
as Christian .

Berti thinks that at some time before Bruno left France
he wrote a book, never published, of which all we know is
that,
two years later, he promised to send his English friend
Smith his
‘ Purgatory of Hell
,
’ wherein you shall see the
fruit of redemption .
” 1 On e judges from the context that
the redemption was from scientific and philosophic error .
IV. THE CHANDLER
The s ame year (
1 5 8 2)
saw another work from Bruno
’
s
rapid pen . This time he wrote in Italian, and the book was
printed by an Italian who had settled in Paris, Guglielmo
Giuliano by name . Bruno tells us it was the fruit of “a
few burni ng It differs wholly from his other
writings ,
for it i s a stage-play,
full of rattling, roaring fun
and furnished with a satiric probe for credulity, pedantry
and pretence . Its world is full of the pursuers and huCk
s te rs of illusions ; rogues abound , and fools are duped by
miracle-mongers, alchemists and pretenders to magic arts .
~
This comedy is entitled
“ Il C and elajo,
” which may be
translated as The Chandler . In Bruno
'
s time the person
who supplied candles also made them . Now the manu
facture of tallow-dips is a noisome and un dignifi ed trade .
Bruno,
like Dante,
loved to load words with more than their
surface-meaning.
3 “ Behold,
”
he says in the dedication ,
behold in the candle borne by this Chandler,
to whom
'
I
gave birth ,
that which shall clarify certain shadows of
ideas . This product of imagination which shall set forth
truth is dedicated with a letter to the lady Morgana, a name
very suggestive of F a ta M orga n a— the mirage— which is
illusion . In this dedication a multitude of ideas surge pell

” 1 Herein are furtive thrusts all round .
The play begins with a few verses . Then comes the
mock-dedication . By a convention dating from classic
times every play required a prologue . Bruno will none of
this . A love of buffoonery pervaded his age, so our author
next gives us a synopsis of the characters and of the three
closely interwoven but distinct plots of his comedy for
prologue and follows this up with an anti-prologue ,
then
with a pro-prologue and finally, before the curtain rises ,
there is a speech from the beadle ; all this, excepting the
synopsis, being done in that spirit of humorous provocation
“
so characteristic of Rabelais .
The play has five acts and eighteen characters , whereof
Bonifacio , an elderly, amorous miser ; Bartolomeo, an
avaricious seeker after the philosopher
’
s stone, and Man
furio, pedant and fool
, are chief.
The pedant is of poor but pretentious intelligence ;
naturally a vessel of mean capacity, which bursts into
absurdities when crammed with more than it was designed
to hold . His ineptitude overflows in affectation and self
conceit, and he speaks in inappropriate Latin or latiniz ed

THE EARLY WORKS 77
Italian . He is a man of words and phrases, of subtle
distinctions with no value in them, and of painstaking
accuracy about trumpery matters . He lugs in classical
lore at every breath . He is unmarried and is specially
attached to his pupil Pollula : it is significant that a female
name is given to the boy .
1 Manfurio has a hand in every
thing that is going on and understands nothing of it ; he is
fooled and laughed at,
eventually falls into the clutch of a
sham watch, and is soundly thrashed , as are the other
protagonists .
Bonifacio, married to the youthful Carubi n a,
is in love
with Vittoria, a lady no better than she should be, who
only pretends to return his affection in order to bleed his
purse . He commits endless absurdities in order to keep
her to himself, and goes to a professor of magic to help
hi m. This gentleman drains him dry ; whereupon Vittoria
manages to substitute Carubi n a for herself. Bonifacio,
in
the dress
- OfBernardo , a painter, who is also in love with
Carubi n a,
is thus confronted by his own wife dressed in
Vittoria
’
s clothes . The pretended watch appear and force
Bonifacio to give a bribe to their captain ; meanwhile
Carubi n a is téte-a-téte with the painter. Finally the
deceived husband has to entreat his wife to pardon him,
and sails into more tranquil waters
“ by the grace of the
Lord and the Madonna .
”
The third protagonist, Bartolomeo,
trusts himself to the
direction of a designing alchemist who well-nigh exhausts
hi s lean purse . A mixture, which contains a fictitious
powder of Christ
”
fails to work and after amusing scenes
of roguery,
the false watch appear and, by threatening
prison , make their profit .
The play is a series of pictures of the seamy side of

Neapolitan life and repeats the coarse talk which Bruno
would hav e heard as a boy . He may have written the
work when he was in the monastery : certain references
and its fresh and vigorous touches smack of the direct
transcript of recent impressions . But a reference to a
recent event shows that it received at least finishing
strokes in France,
if not in Paris . In his castigation of
vice ,
the very unpleasant is unduly prominent
; but the
play is not so foul as those of Machiavelli
, Bibbiena and
Aretino . It must be admitted that this comedy exhibits a
great knowledge of the seamy side of life and is a queer
product of monastic discipline . But not so many years
before a Prince of the Church had officiated at the altar of
the Cyprian as well as at that of Christ
, and his comedy
brought a blush to the face of that by no means severe
prude ,
Isabella D
’Es te, while Erasmus tells us of a priest
who took a part in a Latin play. Even in Bruno
’
s stricter
days of Catholic Reform the full effect of the Council of
Trent was no t felt, and no great blame attached to such
lapses . We must not press too heavily on the fault . The
Renaissance found frank indecency attractive ; we have
become more
“ delicately indelicate . Natural instincts
held in leash are apt to manifest themselves in this vicarious
and disagreeable way, and a
“ virile
” young man ,
in a
“ virile
”
century at least, will roll in the obscene with the
unconstrained gratification of a puppy dog . Moreover,
many young men indulge in obscene speculation for pre
ci s ely
the same reason that lunatic maidens are said to
utter foul oaths : there is fascination in the repellent and
it is apt to produce an undue impression on the mind .
The plot is unduly complicated and reminds the reader
of the Spanish stage . The characters are abstract types ,
like those of Ben Jonson and dramatists of the second
rank ;
but they are drawn with rare felicity . The dialogue
THE EARLY WORKS 79
i s quite as vivacious and clever as any by Aretino
“ The
Chandler
”
is quite sui generi s— a new developmen t in
comedy. It is easy, spontaneous,
the overflow of an ardent
and imaginative temperament . Both the obscenity and
buffoonery of the play are half intended to keep the
audience amused ; buffoonery and indelicac
‘
y are also
introduced with this purpose in Bruno
’
s more serious
writings .
The rediscovery of the classics led,
in time,
to degenerate
humanists : Bruno is less tender to these pedants than to
knaves— probably
“
because he had suffered -more at their
hands .
1 Philosophical theory peeps out i n the play here
and there .

He believes that his enemies rejoice at his exile ; but he
is convinced he will obtain his due,

;
3 a
remark which some have thought to show that he believed
in an immortality not guaranteed by the mere pan theistic
Neo-Platonism he had so far expounded .
I n a somewhat earlier and more liberal age , Machiavelli
expressed his contempt for the miraculous . Gui cci ardi n i
thought those wonders which were best attested to be
examples of natural phenomena not yet understood .
4 This
was Bruno
’
s attitude , as is clear from many passages in his
books . In
“ The Chandler
”
he pours his scorn ori
~ the
trickery of the priesthood . He hints at the miseries of
monastic discipline .
He is aware of his own originality and declares it
;
he
does not disgui se his Horatian contempt for the herd .
There is no evidence that the play was ever performed ;

but,
influenced by prior productions ,
it left its mark in its
turn on those which followed .
1 The comedies of that many
sided genius, Giambattista della Porta (who was a Neapolitan
and a contemporary of Bruno), which were published more
than twenty years later than the Ca n delajo,
show a singular
resemblance to i t .

AT OXFORD
HAVI NG made the disagreeable passage from Calais to
Dover (Bruno
'
s first experience of a journey by sea)
he
would not find that almost distinctive character of English
scenery which obtains to-day . It was more like that of
Northern France . For the most part, corn-land and
pasturage were unenclosed, and there was a vast amount
of uncultivated or poorly cultivated land,
in spite of
enclosures made under the Tudors . He presented his
credentials to the French Ambassador and went on to
Oxford to try his fortunes there .
Opposition , disappointment and defeat always incited
Bruno to some fresh attack on the
“ parrots
” 1 who
foolishly _repeated ancient and defective teaching or,
at
best,
“ tried to excuse the
.
defects of their divinity,
Aristotle .
” 2 Barbarians who dwelt at the ends ofthe
e arth must assuredly be only too glad to welcome so highly
qualified a teacher as he . So he began by beating the
big drum . He sent a foreword to the Vice-Chancellor and
dons of the University which began thus : Jordan us Bruno
of Nola,
lover of God, doctor in a more perfect divinity,
professor of a purer and more harmless wisdom, a philo
sopher known , esteemed and honourably entreated by the
foremost Academies of Europe, a stranger to none but
churls and barbarians ,
the awakener of souls from slumber,
the queller of presumptuous and recalcitrant ignorance, one
1 C. de lo Con eri

who sheweth in all his actions the love he beareth to all
men , whether Briton or Italian ,
female or male, whether
bearing the mitre or the crown ,
the gown or the sword ,
wearing a cowl or withou t one ; but who chiefly yearns
for the man Whose converse is peaceful, human ,
true and
profitable ; he who seeks not for an anointed head or a
crossed brow,
for the washed hand or him that is circum
c i s ed, but for those true lineaments of man which be his
soul and trained understanding ; one who is abhorred of
them that spread foolishness and are but petty dissemblers ,
but whom men proven and in earnest love, and who is
appla uded by the nobler sort
” 1 This is the prelude
to a request for permission to lecture .
2 Was anything
more calculated to
Cleave the general ear,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confoun d the ignorant an d amaz e indeed
”
!
But, after all
,
the epistle only follows the pomposity of
the age with Bru n i an emphasis . Even the most courtly
and polished gentleman of his time, Sir Philip Sidney, when
travelling to the Court of Rudolf II, had his arms emblaz oned
on whatever house he lodged at, with the announcement in

calls her the widow of true knowledge so far as philosophy
and mathematics are concerned .
” He laughed at her pre
tensions to Greek scholarship . Yet,
less than a century
before,
the Ox ford Helleni sts ,
, a1though but a small band ,
were distinguished by the presence of such scholars as
Grocy n , Linacre and Croke, and Erasmus found Greek
better taught in England than i n Italy .
1
Indeed ,
the English Universities had fallen from their
high estate . Sport had always more attraction for the
bulk of English gentry than learning, which was almost
confined to the priesthood . The French wars and still
more the Wars of the Roses were a hindrance to learning .
Even before the Reformation John Barclay wrote of men
Lesynge thei r tyme at the un yversyte,
Yet count they themselfe of great auctoryte
With their proud e hodes on thei r n eckes hangynge,
Th ey haue the lawde ; but others haue the cunn ynge .

tely,

Though they thereto theyr mynd e dyd n euer apply
Without the thynge,
they joy them ofthe name .
” 2
When the Reformation was effected, Erasmus
’
s warning
of the menace it would be to learning proved well-founded .
The dissolution of the monasteries impoverished that
scholarly class which Opened a career to the clever lad
of the people and gave him universi ty in struction . But,
to
employ the words of Descartes ,
the Universities had not
yet begun
“ to make merchandise of science for the better
ing of their fortunes .
”
Theology was the main interest . The dons were, for
the most part, absentees . Appointed by the Court,

of these graduates .
“ On e wore two resplendent gold
chains on his neck ; another
“
twelve rings on two of his
fingers : he looked like a rich jeweller .
” 1 A doctorate was
easily obtained ;
it was purchasable ;
to become a doctor in
medicine only needed a fee and that the candidate should
have been in the habit of perusing medical books during
ten years . The dons
“ knew much more about beer than
about Greek,
”
says Bruno .
2 Most of the students were
quite young lads . The statutes provided that any master
or doctor diverging one jot from the teaching of Aristotle
should be fined five shillings
3 for each offence .
4 No one
could be admitted tothe degree of Master or Doctor unless
he had quaffed of the Aristotelian fountain ; but there were
three fountains in the city, respectively called Aristotle,
Pythagoras and Plato ;
the waters thereof were used to
qualify cider and beer ;
“ so that, Bruno mal1c1ously

” 5
He seems to have found some favour with Matthew,
the
Dean of Christchurch, and with Culpepper,
the Warden of
New . He speaks respectfully of both these clergymen .
6
He would make the acquaintance of Italian teachers at the
University, and he probably met Alberico Gentile there at
festivals or elsewhere . Gentile came to England i n , 1 5 8O
and was appointed professor of Civil Law at Ox ford four
years later . Bruno certainly knew him i n

,

of S iradi a , a Pole, who was in England on a mi s s ion
'
to
prevent the exportation of arms to Muscovy . The visit of
a prince from regions so remote, one, moreover, who was
credited with great bravery as a soldier and with much
linguistic learning,
created a great stir in England, and
Oxford welcomed him with heavy feeding, erudite disputa
tions, spectacular displays and all that ebullience in which
the surcharged vitality of the Renaissance found vent . I t
must have heightened Brun o
’
s acute perception of that
vicissitude to which he constantly refers that Laski, who
had shown his greed of gold by taking the bribes of France
at the election of Henry I II to the Polish crown ,
2
soon had
to steal away from his English creditors, wit
h all precau
tions of silence and secrecy, accompanied by the occultist
Dr John Dee and one Kelly, who was another professor of
the art of transmuting base metal into gold .
Among the entertainers of Laski was Mathew Gwin n e of
St . John
’
s, a young Welshman who became one of Bruno
’
s
English friends and,
later on , helped Florio in his i n com
parable translation of Montaigne . Gwinn e was an all
round man ; he added the accomplishment of music to a
knowledge of French and Italian . He became a dramatic
author (
in Latin ) and possessed of a smattering of physic .

When Laski was at Ox ford, Gwi n n e held forth with others
on such problems as whether males or females are longer
lived,
and whether events can be foretold from the stars .
These disputations , held in honour of the Prince, gave
Bruno his chance . He shall tell his own tale .

even tried to make amends . He admitted that she had
been
“ founded on an excellent basis and was marked by

in these respects, first in Europe, while in
polish and quickness of m1ud she can hold her own .

later Sir Thomas Browne wrote of the Copernican theory
as being still a subject for debate among the learned

BRUNO was i n s ad plight : stranded i n a strange country,
unable to speak its language and with a lank p urse at his
girdle . He found a saviour in the French Ambassador .
Castelnau, he tells us,
rescued him “ from these doctors
and from hunger he proved a firm and effective defender
a solid, secure and enduring rock .
” 1 The Ambas s ador
was himself in pecuniary straits : his salary was i rregu
larly paid and he was obliged to borrow money,
2 but he
gave the wan dermg Italian scholar a home . You did not
maintain a man in your household of whom you had need ,
but one who stood in need of you in many ways ,
” Bruno
wro t e him .
3 “ I remained in his house as his gentleman
merely that .
” Doubtless Castelnau found him of service ;
Bruno frequently accompanied him to the Court of Eliz abeth ,
and the French Ambassador,
in want of money, might have
been glad of the aid of an unofficial secretary at no great
cost .
Michel de Castelnau , Lord of Mauv i s s1ere, was sixty
three years old, a man of considerable learning and ex
peri en ce of life . He was one of the very earliest men north
of the Alps to become a
”
professional diplomatist . He had
travelled in Italy and had served in campaigns there and
elsewhere ; he had been ambassador at the Court of Mary
Stewart and also in Germany, and had represented France

at Eliz abeth
’
s court during the past ten years . He had
literary tastes and had translated Ramus
’
book on
‘ the
Gauls . His memory was excellent
,
and he shows himself,
in the memoirs which he wrote for the instruction of his
two sons, a searcher after causes ,
truthful
, and a man of
impartial judgement .
1 Unhappily he tells us nothing about
Bruno, for the memoirs end with the year I 574 . He seems
to have been reticent and firm but too scrupulous to obtain
great success in diplomacy . It is a testimony to his high
character that while he defended the interests of Mary
Stewart he retained the warm regard of Eliz abeth Tudor .
His great antagonist was the Spanish Ambassador, Bern ar
dino de Mendoz a,
for whom he was a poor match in guile .
Indeed , Castelnau was a broad-minded generous gentleman ,
sincerely religious , but so tolerant that he excused Bruno
from attending mass and the other religious offices held at
his house nay more,
in permitting the dedication to himself
of four of Bruno
’
s works Castelnau accepted three of the
most d ar1n g he ever wrote
!
Bruno found the embassy a peaceful haven, where, for
more than two years, he was sheltered from the blasts
which had whirled him hither and thither for seven years
past and were to swoop on him again . The embassy was
known as Beaumont House ;
it was in Butcher
’
s Row,
3
a
narrow lane which led into the Strand, close by St Clement
Danes, not far from the boundary line of the City— a
timber-framed house, with projecting upper stories and
barge-boarded gables,
the front decorated with fica r-a
’o-li s
and coron ets .

indeed is a fit clothing to her soul
; she is a lady of judge
ment, prudence, modesty and polite dignity,
” 1 whence we
may conclude that the noble lady , who was in failing health at
the time, had still some traces of good looks and was fairly
gracious and kind to Bruno .
But the heart of the monk , pathetically debarred from
fatherhood, went out to the younger of the two girls of the
house,
to whom, perhaps , he gave lessons . One can dis
cover real tenderness in his description of how “ hardly yet
six years of age, she speaks Italian , French and English so
equally well that no one can tell her nationality ;
she plays
various instruments so that one wonders whether she be
flesh or spirit, and from her already ripe and noble bearing ,
whether she be of earth or have come down from the skies .
Both her parents reappear alike in her body and in her
mind .
” 2
I n a year or two both mother and little daughter
were among the dead .
However filled with the music of the starry heavens and
with immortal thoughts, genius is peculiarly geyill to live
wi . We can credit Bruno with being very thin -skinned
and not a little trying at the fi re-side . He honestly believed
himself to be a model of politeness and self-restraint . He
thought that every one was against him .
“ No one ever
blamed me
‘
for discourtesy
”
—s o he assures Castelnau
He plunges us into “ no one can justly complain of me .
’
a cataract of contrasts in order that we may know how
the worthy love and the unworthy maltreat him .
3 Small
worries tortured the nerves of a man whom the cruelest
death could not dismay . Like the rest of us, his was a
strangely compounded clay . Full of noble gratitude, lofty
conception ,
serene wisdom and an heroic pass1on to know
truth and proclaim it
, he was yet a trifle prejudiced , a trifle

irritable and vain , very impulsive and restless, a little snappy,
somewhat resentful
, wholly indiscreet and given to singular
crotchets and ill-timed bursts of strange,
if generous, en thus i
a sms— probably such would be a contemporary
’
s judgement
of Br1
'
1 no . But our wonder at this man of high and con
tin ued purpose is not lessened by his human weaknesses ;
our respect for the unfailing patience and kindness of the
Cas teln aus towards their somewhat difficult guest is
increased .
The passionate Southern Italian , knowing about three
words of the English tongue and,
since he . deems it fit for
dogs , not wishing
'
to learn more,
1 may have got into trouble
in the London streets ;
if so, possibly the lady whose
“ malicious feminine rage and false tears, which can be
more powerful than any volume of swollen billows
” 2 had
something to do with it . S en si n i thinks he got into a row,
was imprisoned,
released by the good offices of Mauv i s s iére
and kept at home for a time
!
! Certainly Bruno rehearses
to Castelnau how “ not only did you receive and sustain me,
but defended me, set me free, held me safe, kept me in
harbour .
” 4 We certainly learn that, on account of his
severe s tr1c tures on the English people,
5 he dared not
appear in the streets and remained shut up at home,
6 and
possibly the lady in question had some hand in this .
Very soon after taking up his abode at Beaumont House,
Bruno must have accompanied his host to the Court,
for he
knew the S panish Ambassador there,
7 and Mendoz a was
ex pelled from England in January 1 5 84 after the detection
of his complicity in the plots against Eliz abeth

Ambassador to Court habitually .
” 1
Italian gentlemen were
welcome at Eliz abeth
’
s Court . She prided herself on her
knowledge of their language ; most of her courtiers had
visited Italy ; many of them were well-versed in Italian
literature, and all formed their manners on the Italian
model . It was to the incalculable advantage of our be
haviour and of our literature that so many gentlemen were
tried and tutored in the world but the less stable spirits
came back from their travels to exhibit
“ strange antic
tricks ,
the absurdity of which Bruno did not catch . But
Shakespeare did . Look you lisp,
says Rosalind,
and wear strange suits and disable all the benefits of
your own country and be out of love with your nativity,
and almost chide God for making you of that countenance
you are, or I will scarcely think you have swam in a
gondola .
”
It was the prevalent passion for Italy and deep
respect for the Italian language and literature which gave
Bruno an Opportunity of publishing,
through a London
press, his noblest works i n his own tongue . There was
no university in London , or its scholars would have d eS p1s ed
any thought
, however profound, which was not expressed
in the language of the learned .
Bruno admired Eliz abeth and wrote of her as superlatively
as custom demanded
! He called her— a Protestant ruler
“ a
’
i wa
”
sacred
”
or
“ divine,
”
just as he did His Most Chris
tian Majesty and the Head of the Holy Roman Empire : it
was treasured against him and brought up at his trial .
3
Of Eliz abeth
’
s courtiers , he neither knew nor ex pected
to know Leicester, at least in the earliest part of 1 5 84 ;
4
but he would certainly be known to Walsingham. He was
noticed by Fulke Greville, a scholarly young courtier, about
two years younger than himself. Greville stood high in

be strained : he proposed to dedicate a book to Greville,
1
but never did so . To Sidney he dedicated his two important
works on moral subjects
!
Sidney was the English representative of Petrarchism,
though he was far from copying the current ignoble and
degenerate affectation of
'
love which now prevailed in Italy .
He tumbled head over ears in love with Penelope Devereux
when she was still a child . The only satisfaction he ever
obtained was a kiss stolen from her when she was asleep ;
but sexual fascination remained so divorced from matrimony
in the six teen th century that he continued to address verses
of passionate devotion to her after she became Lady Rich
with the full knowledge and consent of both his
sister and the lady who was now his wife . He identified
“ Stella with Beauty ;
3 and it is the opinion of the best
judges of the age that the representations of Spenser
4 as
to the sincerity and depth of the passion are calm and
deliberate facts .
” 5 Now Sidney
’
s verses were not published
until after his death ; but they were widely C1rcula ted in
manuscript and were already famou s ; his love for Stella
was generally known . Bruno writes to him as a dis
ti n gui shed poet
;
6 he had been in London and attending
the Court at least considerably more than a year,
if not
over two years, when he did so, and would know therefore
of this passion ,
and of how, repelled by Stella, Sidney had
turned his love to nobler issues than personal gratification ,
thoug
h he nursed it still . Bruno wished to put before Sidney
and the world a higher form of adoration ; he would substitute
devotion to the imperishable beauty of wisdom for the courtly

service of mere perishable charms, whether of body or mind
so , with characteristic z eal and directness of attack and
equally characteristic absence of prudence and tact, he sneers
at
“ that Tuscan poet who display
ed such spasms on the
banks of the Sorgue for a lady of Vaucluse— though I do
not desire to say he was mad .
” 1 No one who was not
entirely insensitive to what might be passing in the mind of
another could write thus . But Bruno was smgularly d efec
tive in this regard and, ultimately,
it brought him to his end .
In the same dedicatory letter there occurs a paean of
virility. It has been remarked that his tone is that of
Walt Whitman ; he 18 strenuous and 1nv 1nc 1ble and male .
” 1 '
Falstaffmight be addressing Prince Hal in the Eastcheap
tavern when Bruno asks :
“ What do I hold ! Am I p er
chance
'
a foe to generation ! Do I hate the sun ! Do I
regret having come into the world ! Shall I keep men
from the delicious fruit of our earthly paradise ! Is it for
me to bar the holy law of nature Shall I try to set myself
or others free from the sweet-bitter yoke which God ,
in His
providence, hath placed on our neck Am I to persuade
myself and others that we are not born to carry on the life

C ae sar the things that are Caesar

which are God

” 3 We should not forget that
,
like Mercutio , Bruno is
“ a gentleman that loves to hear
himself . talk . He will say more in a minute than he will
stand to in a month .
” Nevertheless , here was strange
matter for Sidney

unless there was a side to his character which disappeared
from our view in his apotheosis after Z utphen . And he is
favoured, a little farther on , with the unromantic avowal
,
“ made without blushing,
that a woman is worthy of being
loved in the flower of her beauty and ability to produce
children of Nature and God .
” 1 Still farther on ,
“ the
Nolan contrasts the sexual instinct with intellectual
ardour. A strange address from a poet to a poet ! but at
least it shews that Bruno knew his patron to be broad
minded and tolerant . Sidney would perceive that Bruno
was wholly incapable of covering up a single one of the
many sides to his character and that he trusted to candour
as the best possible title to consideration . It is evidence of
the merit of both men— the sincerity of the suitor is matched
by the tolerance of
“ a spotless friend, a matchles man,
whose vertue ever shinde .
”
Here in London , Bruno seems to have renewed his
acquaintance with Gwynne, and he became friendly with
John Florio, an Oxford man , but an Italian by birth, being
the son of a refugee who was a protestant preacher in this
country. Florio introduces Bruno and an unidentified
adversary at Ox ford as Nolano and Torquato

Several of the Italian books con

tain remarks on England
but the
“ Ash-Wednesday Supper
”
has pages of satiric
observation mingled with half humorous exaggeration ,
never without a touch of severity . Bruno makes some
apology for these in the
“ Causa but sticks to his main
indictment . He was struck by the pasturage in England,
so rich and green , by the splendid flocks of
“ pretty, ex
cellen t, fat, white and nimble lambs

it nourished,
and
by the Englishman

“ lives long on the almsbasket of words
to express his admiration ! On e of the very best stanz as
that he wrote in England praises the
“ gentle nymphs who
make a stay on the green banks of the Thames so charm
ing just before this, he had spoken of
“ the beautiful and
gracious nymphs of Father Thames .
” 1 He noticed the
marking of the royal swans , and the great flocks of crows
how inhuman the game-laws were and how eager was the
Englishman to be a landowner
! He valued the broad
minded Britons who became his friends, and the educated
Italianate gentlemen of the Court . But his disposition was
not a specially forbearing one, and he was fastidious as
Horace in shrinking from the rude humours of the mob .
“ I hate the populace
”
he told Castelnau .
3
To pass from Italy to France was to go back more than
one generation in polish of manner and cultivation of mind ;
and,
compared with France, England was still a semi
barbarous country . Poetry, after nearly two centuries of
almost complete silence, was indeed chirping the first im
perfect notes ofa new morning-song,
and Spenser trilled a
fresh , delightful music in his
“ S hepheard

Lyly in

I cannot do so . I do not dispute that, at some time, Greville
may have heard Bruno debating the point, perhaps in his
own apartment, and certainly it would be a very frequent
subject of discussion between Bruno and his friends or
visitors at Beaumont House, and he admits that this was
the case at supper on an Ash Wednesday . When asked
by the Inquisitors whether he had written concerning an
Ash Wednesday Supper and what was his purpose therein ,
he replied : I havewritten a book in fi ve dialogues so
entitled, which dealt with the earth
’
s movement , and , because
I debated the matter in En gland at an Ash Wednesday
supper with certain doctors of medicine a t the hous e ofthe
F rench Amha ss a dor a t whi ch I dw el t,
I called the dialogues
the Ash Wednesday Supper . I t may be that there are
certain errors in the book which I cannot now recall pre
c is ely .
1 The book was intended to ridicule these doctors
and their opinions concerning these matters .
” 1 The In
qui s i tors did not pursue the subject . It has been suggested
that Bruno deliberately made a false s tatemen t
’
a s to where
the supper took place in order to minimiz e hi s Offence, and
located it,
therefore , at the house of an orthodox Catholic .
That would not be like Bruno : like other men he sometimes
evades an inconvenient question or puts the best face he
can on the answer he is obliged to give, but,
to direct
unescapable questioning, he invariably gives perilously
s traight rward repl
ies . . The Inquisitors knew about the
book ;

cerned . And he could not have forgotten where the supper
was held after he had written a whole book around it A
careful examination of the work convinces me that
, while
the supper and disputation are based on facts,
these have
been altered, rearranged and played upon by Bruno
’
s lively
imagination and worked up into literary form . He wants
to make discussion go down by furnishing attractive dishes
he wants at the same time to Open the safety—valve of his
I ndignation at British obtuseness and British manners . If
he and a few friends discussed Natural Philosophy and fish
together on Ash Wednesday,
it would be quite in his manner
to turn the Aristotelian physics and cosmology into a
Supper of Ashes .
”
He more than hints that he has invested everything with
such literary merit in his prefatory letter to Castelnau .

of the palace itself, and Bruno, who gibes at their rudeness ,
1
may have directed his sarcasm at Eliz abeth

becaus e he had experienced small courtesy at their hands
Ifmy view be correct , Bruno has run together a multi
tude of ex periences , one of which may have been at
Greville
’
s table, and adorned them, not merely to
“ ridi
cule these doctors ,
”
but also to satiriz e English manners .
Le t us look at Eliz abeth

s London through Bruno
’
s eyes .
Two messengers come to him from a certain esquire at
the Court, asking him to give his views concerning the
Copernican theory . He replies that he does not see
through Copernicus
'
eyes, but with his own
! We nex t
find Bruno i n conversation with Fulke Greville, whom
we must infer is the esqu ire in question . Greville asks
Bruno why he believes in the rotation of the earth . Bruno
replies that he has not the measure of Greville
’
s capacity
for grasping it ; he (Bruno) may be as one of those
who talk to images and address the dead ;
i fGreville will
fu rnish the reason for hi s belief he will reply to it .
Greville is very pleased at this answer, and invites Bru n o
to meet and discuss the problem with a company of gentle
men and learned folk on Ash-Wednesday . Bruno accepts ,
but begs that Opponents may be chosen who are not
ignoble people, miscreate and of small understanding in
these matters . Master Fulke replies that Bruno need have
no fear,
for the men he has in mind are of the best learning
and behaviour .
” 1 The
“ learning and behaviour
”
thus skil
fully introduced is by no means ex hibited to their advantage
in the sequel . Bruno hears no more of the matter, and when
the day appointed comes round he waits and waits dinner

so he gives the whole thing up and goes

out to call on some Italian friends . . He does not return
to Beaumont House till after sunset and, behold, John
Florio and Matthew Gwynne are kicking their heels at the
doorway while they impatiently await his return . They
tell him he must hurry on with them ;
for a company of
knights, gentlemen and doctors have assembled at Greville
’
s
and expect him . Bruno is aggrieved and shows it : he
supposed he should be asked to dinner and discuss the
matter with a long d ay ahead . Gwynne says certain knights
desired to be pres ent, but they were unable to come to
dinner and have come to the later meal . Reading between
the lines , Bruno, while always ready to pral s e those English
gentry who have travelled in Italy and learned manners
there, has received a slight or so from them and resents
it . It i s conceivable that Greville may have found in this
some side-hit at himself.
Our author then works up his London experiences ,
placmg the narrative in the mouth of Teofilo, who serves
as his own mask .
The little party who ,
although i n such a
’
hurry, have
taken anything but the shortest cut, reach the great watery
highway— the safest,
speediest and pleasantest route to
Westminster .
“ Yelling oars we wasted as much time as
it would have taken to go by land and do a , trifle of busi
ness on the way. At length two boatmen answered from
afar and slowly,
S lowly drew In . After much question and
reply as to whence, where, why, how and when ,
they brought
the prow to the foot of the s
tairs . An d 10 ! one of them,
who might have been old
t
Charon , held out his hand to the
Nolan , and another, who was his son I think— a fellow of
about 6 5
— took us in .
” The boat looked like a cork— i t was
so ancient and worm-eaten— but it went like lead, so palsied
were the arms of the rowers . Its creakings and gratings,
mingling with the splash ,
splash of the feeble oarsmen , were
I O GIORDANO BRUNO
the burlesque of a musical accompaniment and incited Florio
to break out with a love-ditty, and Bruno followed on with
another song .
“ It took us a long time to make little way
and, before we had covered a third of our journey,
just past
a place c alled the Temple, our old fathers ,
instead of hurry
ing on ,
turned the prow shorewards . The Nolan asked ,
‘What are you doing ! Do you want to take breath !
’
Their answer was interpreted to him : they were not going
farther ;
their station was at this spot . Entreaty after
entreaty proved worse than useless Having paid and
thanked them (what else cq ld be done to such scoundrels
in such a place they showed us the way to the street .
The footpath commenced in mud which , milly willy, must be
gone through .
” Here comes a sly laugh at himself,
in the
satiric S pirit which pervades the whole composition : The
Nolan , who had studied and taught in the schools more
than we,
said,
‘
I Observe a filthy way out : follow me .
’
But while he was yet speaking, he got so firmly stuck
in the mud that he could not
‘
stir a limb ; and we had to
help one another, hoping that this purgatory would soon
come to an end . But by malicious luck, he and we found
ourselves engulfed in a slimy passage, which was sur
rounded by strong walls, as if it had been a veritable
enclosure of jealousy or a garden of delights . And, there
being no light to guide us, we could not tell the way back
or on ;
so, hoping every step would be the last, we waded
on up to the knees through that deep and gloomy hell .
Bruno must have sighed for his Italian cities, their side
streets ,
even, paved with stone !
At last the adventurers came to a mud-cake with a stony
margin where they could walk dry-foot, but in some danger
of tumbling and breaking head or limb .
“ Finally, we
a rrived at what seemed to us to be the Elysian fi elds
.the main street and behold ! there we were about
I I 2 GI ORDANO BRUNO
men . Even small t radesmen educated at the grammar.
schools Could write to one another in Latin ,
so,
in deference
to the . doctors ,
the debate was conducted in that language,
since Bruno spoke no English .
The portraits of Bru no
’
s opponents were engraved for
all time by a scornful, pitiless burin : there they stand,
self
important pompous pedants . One
“ has an emphasis on
his face such as the Father of the Gods wore when he sat
at the celestial council to fulminate an awful sentence
against impious He
“ admired the gold chain
rou nd his neck and then glanced at the Nolan
’
s breast ,
where the loss of a button were more likely to be found .
”
“ Then he sat bolt upright ,
took his elbows off the table,
shook himself a little , gave a short snort, adjusted his velvet
cap ,
twirled his moustache, made his scented face assume a
due ex pression , arched his eyebrows, distended his nostrils ,
cast a glance backward,
set himself in order,
struck an
attitude— left hand to left side, as if he were opening a
fencing
-match- held up three fingers of his right hand and
began , with a few prelImIn ary flourishes .
” 1
But the longer Bru no stayed in England the more recon
ciled he became to its ways . He even finds it
“ a beautiful,
fortunate and chivalrous country .
’ When in German y he
forgot the petty annoyances and disappointments he had
ex perienced and ex pressed his admiration at the aggressive
achievements of our sea-dogs .
3 After all
, he had spent the
most peaceful days he ever knew during his ex ile in England .
A French contemporary wrote of blessed England,
the
abode of quiet and humanity .
” 4 Yet even here the Nolan
”
was far from feeling settled ;
for Ca s teln au
’
s recall had been
issu ed and he had longawaited it to be put into effect .
‘
And
even the most distinguished among Eliz abeth

far from recogniz ing the genius of the most distinguished

contemporary
Englishmen seem to have had small i nkling of the profound
originality of his speculations his Neo-Platonism they could
easily grasp and found it all too familiar his subject-matter
was ,
in truth , not cared for, and his Italian style, by no
means easily read, even by his own countrymen , was very
unpleasing to a generation that delighted in Tasso .
At last,
late in October,
1 5 8 5 ,
the Castelnau family went
back to France, Bruno with them . Black clouds were already
gathered roun d the Ambassador ;
still more evil days awaited
that generous gentleman . During the journey he was robbed
of everything he had, down to his shirt . He landed at Calais
in a state bordering on destitution
! A recently discovered
manuscript informs us that Bruno, who, even less than
Castelnau, could afford the loss of worldly goods , was also
plundered . A diarist enters , under Dec 2 7,
1 5 8 5 , Jordan us
has told me that his man-servant either has robbed him or
suffered him to be robbed .
” 3
Bruno had spent two an d a half of the years when a
man
’
s powers are at their fullest flow in Eng
land ,
and
these years had witnessed the writing and actual produc
tion of great books . Not content with these labours he was
busy at an astronomical work ,
to be called the
“ Purgatory
of Hell
,
" which he promised to lend to Smith
“ that he
might see the fruit of redemption .

He makes an advance on the Neo-Platonists in declaring
intellect to be always with us, whether we are aware ofthe
fact or not ;
1
there is an evolution from sense upwards ,
more complex and more perfect as it ascends
! On e Prin

these be high or low for Essence, Power, Activity, Actua
li ty and Possibility are all one in the last resort
,
as Parme

3 The guides of the Intellect are Love,
the
producer of all things ; Art, which is highest when nearest
Nature (
for in Nature the Soul of the World
4 operates) ;
Mathematics and True Magic , which reveals the inner
nature of things .
5 Form and Matter do not exhaust
themselves in any particular thing ;
they are endless

,
and that Logic 1s a S harp spur , but
emotion is its driving force . And he expresses his abhor
rence of the enthronement of suffering by
‘
religion . He is
at one with the less cautious of the Psychical Researchers
of our own time ; he accepts the levitation of St Thomas
Aquinas ,
second sight ,
the migration of the soul
, and trances ,
wherein a wise control

unites with the spirit of the

THE AS H WED NES DAY SU P PER
In the next work ,
so full of those English experiences
with which we have already dealt , Bruno for the first time
gave his great origi n al genius free S cope in a novel di rec
tion . At a time when the old Greek questioning of ex peri
ence had been w ell nigh abandoned for centuries , and before
the advent of methods of induction , he provided ,
to borrow
Bacon
’
s phrase, anticipations of Nature rather than
reasoned interpretations .
” 1 These were brilliant
, and ,
if
somewhat rash ,
they have usually turned out to be true .
He perceived that to get at truth you must extract it from
Nature, wherein it lies imbedded like her own gold . Nature
is the one solid ground on which to build for aye . He
was one of the first to break away from the worship of
a n tiqui ty a n d the retention of time-mouldered Opinion and
to Open a new era .
The
“ Cena De Le Ceneri
” “ The Ash-Wednesday
Supper has five brisk, entertaining dialogues between
four interlocutors . Teofi lo, who is Bruno under another
name,
recounts those famous episodes we know of and
defends the Nolan
’
s views to Bruno
’
s friend Smith , Trulla
and Prud en ti o,
the last named being a representative of
narrow-minded,
ignorant and obstructive pedantry in general
and ,
in particular, of thoSe , Peripatetics who
“ get heated
over what they don
’
t understand— not even the titles of
Aristotle
’
s books .
” 1 As we know,
the talk is enlivened
with caustic observations on the Aristot
‘
elians and social
England ,
for these animals have no such tender skins .
that they would mind a trifle of blows yet heavier .

patrician and scholarly prejudice agains t the common herd,
those
souls ofgeese
That bear the shape ofmen .
Bruno took his Opportunity of being among Italianised
Englishmen to write in his own tongue ;
in this ,
as in
much else, being a pioneer ;
for he was one of the first to
treat of such high matters as philosophy and science in a
modern language ; nor was the dignified and once con
v en i en t habit of addressing the cultured classes in Latin
quite abandoned until two centuries later .
He will give full ex pression in his native Neapolitan to
his fulness of thought and feeling . His style , he determines ,
shall imitate the painter,
“ who does not content himself
with depicting his main subject, but,
in order to fill his
canvas and to make art conformable with nature, puts in
rocks , mountains ,
trees ,
fountains, streams and hillocks .
Here , you may find a royal palace,
there, a wood ; here a
strip of sky with the half of a rising sun , and,
scattered
about
, a bird , a pig, a stag , a donkey , a horse ; but these
merely indicated by head , horn or limb or ears, even , may
suffice ; but at another spot is the whole shape of a beast ;
some characteristic movement or expression is given ;
so
that one discerns everything with enhanced interest ; one
criticises and, finally, centres one
’
s attention on the main
subject .
” 1 Again , he tells us he will achieve
“ a full and
mighty prose,
taking its own time ;
coming , not as of clerkly
art
, but flowing and strong as are the waters of a mighty
current .
” 1
With what success does he pursue this aim He records

to move to its own proper place ; hence there can be only
one world . Like Plato, Aristotle conceived of the stars as
being souls of a god—like nature ,
1
the cau ses of physical
change
! Such was the accepted faith . Bruno conceived
it to be his mission to destroy every article of it which
pertained to physical theory . He carried it on with z eal .
Not of him as of Aristotle can it be said that he was
moderate to ex cess .
”
In the
“ Supper
”
Bruno
’
s bent towards natural s c1enc e
bursts forth with all the sudden vigour of an I talian spring .
Henceforward the secrets OfNature claim the greater part
of his attention . He did not accept the Copernican theory
in his youth ;
1 but when he became convinced of its truth
he was the first to see beyond it . Liberated from the fetters
of the past by the geniu s of one solitary thinker , he sent a
search-light throu gh the heavens and applied Copernicus
’
theory to the fixed stars . IfNature repeats her operations
in planets all of which revolve round the sun , each S howing
bu t a variation of one single plan , shall she cease to repeat
herself through an unending universe of stars and planets
The universe is all of a piece ;
the principles which obtain
on earth are observed throughou t space . Here lies his
indisputable merit . He was the first to extend the Coper
nican theory to all the hosts of heaven . He did so with
characteristic boldness . It was a marvellou s sweep of the
scientific imagination , for we must remember that Galileo
and Newton had not yet come to supply their confirmatory
evidence . He went further : he was soon to declare that
the physical u niverse occupies i n fi n i ty
— a magnificent con
ce pti on which the hardihood of the science of to-day would
perhaps hesitate to affirm .

He accepts the animation of the universe ;
some creatures
are vastly higher, others vastly lower than we are but the
earth ,
the planets ,
the stars , are
“ celestial animals, more
intellectual than we.
” 1
In a universe which is infinite and
eternal
“ the flaming bodies of space are the messengers of
God, declaring his excellent glory and majesty. Thus our
vision is enlarged to behold the infinite effect of the infinite
Cause, and we are taught to seek the divinity not far offbut
closer to us than we are to ourselves .
” 1 He perceived that
if the discovery of Copernicus had diminished the im
portance of man in the Universe,
it had exalted him as a
being capable of grasping so large a view . The Aris
toteli an view of the Universe was based,
like the plain
man
’
s , on sensible appearance ; but it is the function of the
intellect to pass beyond the mere appearances of S ense to
truth .
3 Yet,
to do this we must Observe Nature and ,
quitting the Aristotelian definitions of Essence and Attri
bute and the like, we should examine natural phenomena
and enquire for the conditions under which events do or do
not happen .
Existence and its Cause are alike Infinite, and nothing
perishes though everything changes .
“ This
r
en ti re globe ,
this star, not being subject to death , and dissolution and
annihilation being impossible anywhere in Nature ,
from
time to time renews itself by changing and altering all its
parts .
” 4 There is no absolute up or down , as Aristotle
taught ; no absolute position in space ; but the pos i tIOn of
a body is relative to that of other bodie s . Everywhere
there is incessant relative change in position throughout
the universe, and the Observer is always at the centre of
things . All celestial bodies are no less secure than is the

Earth ;
they require nothing to support them ! There is
no absolute lightness or weight in things, as Aristotle
taught, but (here he almost foreshadows the great dis
cov ery of Newton)
they have a certain impetus towards or
away from each other
! He accepts an ancient scientific
conception
"
: there is certainly an ether ;
for movement can
only take place by direct contact ; but,
S ince the ether is
too light to move the heavenly bodies,
they must be pro
pelled by the energy of their souls .
1 The sun moves on its
axis ; but this is not all : it varies its position among the
stars, of which it is one . He tells us of the discovery of
Cusanus that there are spots in the sun ,
4 and he attributes
the scintillation of the stars to their bein g suns which give
out their own light ; Venus does not twinkle, because hers
is a reflected light
! He observes that the Earth
’
s atmos
phere rotates with her. Much shrewder is the geologic
discernment that natural forces are in constant operation
and produce very S low but vast changes in land and sea .
6
Bacteriologists may choose to find a remarkable an ti
c 1pation of modern discovery in the passage :
“ It seems
to me more than likely,
since everything shares in life,
that a countless multitude of creatures live not only in
us but in all composite things
” 7 He goes on to say :
“ when we observe anythmg to die as we call it we S hould
not so much believe it to be death as change ;
the mere
accidental composition and harmony ceasing, but the things
to which they happen remaining immortal whether they be
spiritual or material

From a perusal of Algaz el
,
the Arabian theologian , he
has learned that religl on s have a practical object : the1r
ordinances are designed
”
for good conduct, general welfare ,
social needs, peace and the progress of the State
1 Their
authority must be recognised ; but there are as many
interpretations of the abstract and metaphoric as there
are faiths
!
Now such early Fathers of the Christian Church as
Tertullian and Augustine had taught that much of Scrip
ture must be regarded as purely allegorical
;
4 Aquinas had
emphasiz ed their doctrine! and Dante had ex pounded i n
the vernacular that such speech must accommodate itself
to your mind . Scripture condescends to your faculty of
comprehension .
” 6 But it was a great advance to declare
that religi ous embody a merely practical attitude , and have
nothing to do with theoretic truth— an advance on the
compromise of William of Ockham and Duns Scotus, who
excused the results of their dialectic by asserting that,
however much the results of reason may contradict the
teachings of the Church , both are equally true . Bruno
will have but one final truth and one final reality, and
the approach thereto is by the free ex ercise of intellect .
7
He foresaw the quarrel between science and religion , bu t
thought,
if the Scriptures were interpreted in the light of
science,
this might be avoided
! Nay, he is persuaded that
lofty minds will find support in religion more than in any

ON CAUS E, PRI NCI PLE, AND THE ONE
This is a brilliantly original treatise on Metaphysics .
The new view of the Universe carried with it a perception
o f the inadequacy of scholasticism and the need of a
new departure in Philos oPhy .
1 The work consists of five
dialogues .
2 The first of these has three interlocutors and
is intended to excuse and vindicate the strictures on
England which had proved distasteful . In the four fol
lowing dialogues , Teofilo expounds the Nolan
’
s philosophy
to Gervis, Dickson and a humanist called Poli n n i o. The
dialogues are prefaced by a letter to Castelnau and five
short poems, of which three are in Latin and two in
Italian . These verses strike that note of lofty thought and
feeling which finds fuller expression later on in the work .
Bruno springs from the ground and wings S kyward like
the lark ,
soaring in ever widening circles , floating his
throbbing song into the infinite, but interrupting it now
and again by a sudden drop for rest to the homely earth .
Throughout Bruno
’
s life-work we find Plato
’
s doctrine of
Ideas and the Neo—Platonic imagery of Emanation becoming
less and less operant . In the
“ Cause
”
he takes up
Aristotelian conceptions and works by means of these
philosophic distinctions , as Well as through certain theo
logic distinctions,
to an I ndependent View . But, while he
is obliged to use current terminology and the categories
of Aristotle and the schoolmen , he feels that they hamper
him in getting his thought out clearly and unmistakably.
Aristotle never tires of distinguishing by reason What

He has worked himself through the trammels of scho
lastic termi nology and subtle but inadequate distinctions ;
but they are mental currency and there is no other way
than to employ them . S O he begins by distinguishing
between Principle and Cause . A Principle is that which
lies within the constitution of a thing and is necessary to
its being, while the cause of a thing is ex ternal to it, yet
concurs with it as necessary to its production . Now
the Schoolmen , following Aristotle,
employed certain useful
distinctions in Causality . Bruno deals ,
therefore, with
Cause as Efficient,
the source of change ; Formal
,
that which
makes a thing what it is,
and Final
, purpose to be attained .
In the Efficient cause of the Universe he discovers the
Universal Mind, which is the inmost, most real and
characteristic faculty and potential aspect of the Universal
Soul .
"
It is not fully ex pressed in any particular thing,
and,
so far,
is ex trinsic ; yet it also Operates within the
thing,
and is therefore also intrinsic . The Formal Cause
is that
“ ideal reason without which the agent could not
operate any more than an artist can work without the idea
of his work in his mind . The Final Cause of the Universe
is its
“ perfection , wherein ,
in different parts of matter, all
the forms actually ex ist . This end so delights and satisfies
the universal intellect that it never wearI es m gi vmg birth
to all kinds of forms in matter .
” 1 But while the
“ ideal
reason , as presupposed i n the actual,
is a Cause,
as
actualiz ed ,
it is a Principle . We find that,
in this regard,
Principle and Cause coincide . So far we have been dealing
with Forms (
another a n c1en t distinction )
2 we have also
to deal with the Matter in which they are realiz ed, using

the term as that out of which anything may come to be
formed .
Ofcourse there is not to be found in Bruno any shar p
distinction between the
“ thinking thing and the
“ extended
Until Descartes made that distinction ,
thinkers thing .
’
were content
, with the child and with primitive man ,
to
take body and soul as a unity in action . In less mature
years, he had indeed been led away by ancient philosophers
and Avicebron , and had regarded Matter as the sole s ub
stance of things
“ But on deeper thought and taking
other facts into consideration , we must distinguish between
form and material substance .
” 1 The Soul of the Universe
must be as the individual soul and,
to use our Old image ,
may be likened to a pilot guiding a vessel,
2 who is none
the less
- within that which he guides . In our world Matter
and Form are never separate . Virgil knew this when he
wrote that the world is interpenetrated by Spirit and that
Mind moves Mass .
3 Solomon declares the same thing when
he says The Spirit of the Lord fille th the world : and that
which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice .
” 4
“ If Spirit
, Soul
, Life,
is in all things ,
it is the form of
all things, directing and governing matter .
” 5 Forms are
for ever changing ; what has been ,
in the vicissitude of
things, becomes nothing ;
there must be something,
then,
beyond the varying forms of S pirit ;
there must also be
something beyond varying material forms .
6 There must
be a Soul of the Universe which gives it unity . We must
conclude that this exists wholly in the whole and in every
part . To understand how this may be,
let us borrow a
metaphor from Plotinus It is as a voice which is wholly

throughout the whole of a room and in every part of it
;
it is wholly heard by all . Could it fill the whole
universe it would still be all in all .
” 1
It became a necessity with the early mediaeval thinkers
to posit s avs z
‘
ame. In a nugget of gold,
for example,
there
is yellowness, hardness, etc .
; but these qualities are to be
found elsewhere also . They exist in unity in the nugget,
and the inexplicable fact that they do so may be indica
ca ted by the word substance . Later on ,
in order to support
the doctrine of transubstantiation ,
they went further and
attributed to substance an underlying, enduring reality
which supports
”
its accidents . To substance, Unalter
able and ever the same with itself, attributes were ascribed .
Bruno usually employs and works through the earlier
notion ofsubstance,
the
“ I know not what of Locke ,
which gives unity .
2
We allow substantive value to brute matter and also to
spirit . Let us consider material substrate,
that invisible
something which gives one-n ess to all visible forms .
It exists not merely in actual being, but also as the possi
bili ty of being . All that is possible and all that is actual
mu st be referred to a principle which is both possibility and
substance . Everything that exists is possible, but power
or potency has caused it to be . So matter is more than an
ex isting substrate ;
it is potentiality and possibility and
actuality in undistinguished unity. Aristotle held the i n
finite to be potential only, not actual .
Now in what relation does the substrate of brute matter
stand to Spirit or Form in general ! The spiritual and
material worlds can be distinguished ; but there can be no
distinction without an underlying identity ;
so we are

Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists , while apprehending the
one-ness of the Universe, had divorced unity from reality
and unwarrantably asserted the independent being of a
mere abstraction . Bruno advanced far beyond this ; nor,
although Schelling fou nd in the Nolan
’
s thought a kinship
with his own , was Bruno
’
s Absolute a mere I n a
’
ifl
'

“ blank featureless Identity .
” “ We rejoice
”
he
writes
“ in the unity of the sensible (

le)
but
most of all in that which comprehends in itself all sensi
bili ty in one knowledge which comprehends all cognitions ,
in one power of apprehension which embraces all that can
possibly be apprehended,
in one being which completes
everything ; most of all
,
in the unity which is the whole
itself.
” 1
It is absolute simplicity -not because it is ab
stract, not because no differences ex ist within its bosom,
but because all divisions are healed in the one single com
prehensive, harmonious intuition which is God . In other
words Bruno arrives at On e Reality, which moves and
knows itself in its many aspects and is that Whole in and
through which the manifold exists . All things in process
are nothing apart from the Whole .
“ The highest good,
the highest perfection ,
the highest blessedness consists in
the unity which enmeshes
‘
the all .
” 2
Bruno
’
s thought reappears in Spinoz a, whom he directly
influenced ;
3 but Bruno
’
s speculations are less rigid , statical
and systematic than Spinoz a
’
s . Bruno never loosens his
hold on the notion of Living Spirit . He stands by his
master, Cusanus ; philosophy points for both thinkers to
the union of all distinctions and contraries in that which

transcends and includes them and which is no mere collec
tion of parts or mere unity of parts . Both men were on the
road towards the Metaphysic of a great English thinker of
our own day :
1
they had the root-idea of an all-including
Absolute , wherein are all centres of experience
‘
and all
difi
'
eren ces as such , but not merely as such : in and for the
Whole they are also transmuted and harmoniz ed .
Whatever else the Absolute may be we know that, as
transcendent,
it unites all contraries in one perfect cogn i
tion ; as immanent it is the Universal Soul
, unfolding the
eternal meaning,
infinite and without beginning or end .
Living out our share Ofthe divine meaning and being actually
one with the Infinite and Eternal
, we need not fear death .
Bruno flatters himself that he has
“
taken away the dread
of Orcus and greedy Charon, which spoils the sweet of
Iife:
" 2
Such are the conclusions o f R eason ,
let Theology say
what it will . But discreet theologians will always admit
natural reasoning, whithersoever it may lead , provided it does
not dispute divine authority but submits to i t .
” 3
Indeed,
from the early days when Scotus Erigena wrote,
there had
been thinkers who had no desire to oppose dogma if they
were permitted to interpret it by their own metaphysical
conclusions nor had the Church thought it wise to interfere
with them seriously . As has been said ,
from the less coura
geon s days of William of Ockham and Duns Scotus , philo
sophy had evaded the interference of the Church and secured
some independence in p
hilo sophic thinking by a dodge.
Truth was held to be of two kinds , philosophic and theologic ,
which might be in opposition to one ano ther . Bruno be
longed to the bolder line OfErigena .

It has been generally supposed that Bruno,
following
Cusanus , had some dim perception Ofthe possibilities of a
dialectic method when he wrote : Profound magic is it to
draw the contrary out after having discovered the point of
union
1 Hegel in his revi
ew of Bruno
’
s philosophy found
in this a great word .
” 2 Schelling,
too, discovered in
Bruno a spirit akin to his Own in his attempt to deduce the
Universe logically from the point of union .
” 3 But it is
very doubtful whether he had fi rs t-hand acquaintance with
the Causa . Bruno
’
s point of View seems to me to be closer
to that of the thinker who is to day in fashion for he is of
the intuitive rather than of the logical
, abstract school .
Bergson writes :
“ Concepts , as we shall show elsewhere,
generally go in Couples and represent two contr aries . There
is hardly any concrete reality which cannot be Observed
from two opposing standpoints , which cannot consequently
be subsumed under two antagonistic concepts . Hence a
thesis and an antithesis which we endeavour in vain to
reconcile logically,
for the very simple reason that it is impos
sible, with concepts and observations taken from outside
points of view,
to make a thing . But from the object, seiz ed
by intuition , we pass easily in many cases to the two con
t
'
rary concepts ; and, as in that way thesis and antithesis
can be seen to spring from reality, we grasp at the same
time how it is that the two are Opposed and how they are
reconciled .
” 4
Bruno writes :
“ It is one and the same series whereby
Nature descends to the production of things and the intel
lect ascends to the cognition of them ; and in both unity

natural sense . That physician who shall cure me is
better than others who kill or torment me .
” 1
In fact he
was ready to employ those forces which he did not under
stand ,
just as we employ electricity . He accepted much of
the miraculou s as due to undiscovered natural causes . He
hints at this when he writes :
“ I am not now considering
that not without reason do n ecroman ti s ts hOpe to do much
with the bones of the dead , believing that these retain
some vital activity.
” 2
The dialogue of the Causa is natural even at its highest
flights . Sometimes Bruno thinks to give his readers breath
ing time by digressions, which , however,
are anything but
restful . Every now and the n ,
to press a point, he calls
every auxiliary he can think of into his service; every kind
of sacred writing,
the lore ofstrange peoples and of far
distant ages is drawn u pon ; any utterance,
sacred or
profane,
in which he can detect a resemblance to his own
views ,
is pounced upon and cited as authority. For is
there not a m easure of the truth in all things ! Without
any discrimination he heaps together Mystics and Magi,
the
Cabala and the Latin poets . Wonder
-workers and wise
men are referred to as of equal value . The effect on the
modern reader is comic . Goldsmith, one thinks , must have
come across him when he put S an chon i a thon , Manetho ,
Berosus and Ocellus Lucanus into the mouth of the vendor
of the gross Ofgreen spectacles to Moses Primrose .
IV
THE INFI NITE U NIVERS E AND ITS WORLDS
This work begins with a dedicatory letter to Castelnau
which contains much
“
self-revelation— words which he had
not dared to write to one who knew him so well had they
1 Cau sa, Di al . I I I .
2

WORKS PRI NTED I N LONDON 37
been other than strictly sincere .
“ I wish, he writes ,
the
world to posse ss the glorious fruit of my labour,
to awaken
the soul and open the understanding of those who are
deprived of that light which, most assuredly,
is not mine
own invention . Should I be in error,
I do not believe I
wilfully go wrong . And in speaking and writing as I do
I am not contending through the desire of being victorious
for I deem every kind of renown and conquest -God
’
s foe,
vile and without a particle of honour in it
,
if it be not the
truth ; but, for love of true wisdom and in the effort to
reflect aright
,
I weary,
I rack,
I torment myself.
” 1
He will give his reasons for holding that the Universe
endures ,
ever one and itself,
in eternal flux throughout
infinite space .
“ From which contemplation ,
if we apply
the mind, we shall neither be dismayed by incidence of
pain and dread nor exult in pleasure and hope ; we S hall
pursue the path of right conduct, shall be large-minded
observers of puerile thoughts and shall behold greater
matters than gods whom the vulgar adore we shall secure
clear-sighted contemplation of the course of nature, which is
written in ourselves , and observe, with even tenor,
those
divine laws which are graven in our hearts .
”
I The same
nature is to be found in the skies as here ;
so we may quit
ourselves of the vain desire and stupid anxiety and hanker
ing after distant good ;
for it is already at hand and with
us .
” “ By means of this knowledge we shall surely attain
that well-being which we so vainly seek elsewhere .
” 2
The consideration of the Universe as the manifestation
of God will
, he considers , set the human S pirit free . Here
is the philosophy which Opens the senses ,
contents the soul ,
enlarges the mind and brings true blessedness to man
For deeply considering the Being and Substance in which
we are fixed, we find there is no such thing as death, not

for us alone, but for the true substance . Substance never
diminishes but changes , and this throughout infinite space .
Since ,
in the vicissitudes of particular being, we are all
subject to the best Efficient Cause , we ought not to believe ,
think or hope otherwise than that everything, which is
wholly derived from the good,
is good,
through good and
to good . The contrary can only be held by one who
understands nothing but what is immediately before him
the beauty of an edifice is not to be judged from its smallest
part but is most apparent to him who views the
whole and the relation of part to part .
” 1 Good and evil
are contraries which are ,
in fact
,
eternally reconciled in the
eternal core of being— the That Which intrinsically brings
to pass
” 2
the whole of reality,
“ wherein we live
‘
in an
Contraries imply that which transcends appointed order .
’
and holds them in harmonious u nity. God is above Good
and Evil
, but our highest conception of him is as Good .
3
The Divine one extols his own glory and sets forth the
greatness Ofhis sway, not in one sun , but in uncountable
suns ; not in one earth , but in worlds without end .
” 4
After the letter to Castelnau come three sonnets , and then
all the new intellectual tendencies of the era are brought to
a head and the directions which science was to follow are
pointed out in five dialogues . Bruno habitually introduces
real people into his dialogues as interlocutors, and,
in the
first four of the I nfi n i te, Filoteo ex pounds the Nolan philo
sophy to Girolamo Fracastoro ,
the humanist,
5 and two other

later on .
More convincing, perhaps , are other arguments which
may be quickly summariz ed . Our sense -perception is
limited and changes with change of posi tion ; but we can
appeal to reason , which shows all the observations of sense
to be entirely relative, as are constructions based on them .

Here is where I stand (my n ew is what I immediately
experience)
. Position and motion in space (
and time) must
be conceived as relative to any point which we choose to
take for the purpose of comparison . In the Universe there
is no centre and no circumference ; but the centre is every
where , and every part is outside some other part .
” 1
In all
this may we not detect some glimmering, primitive per
c eption ,
some feeble germ of an idea which has been
developed by Lorentz and others into the revolutionary
“ Principle of Relativity But Bruno lived too early,
science was too little developed for him to pursue his
thought ; he thinks that, although not the Transcendent
Absolute , he can rise above sense and its interpretations
and grasp the real conditions in which the World-Soul expo
ri en ces
-
its vicissitudes . S O far as sense goes ,
it reveals
spacial continuity, and so it should be interpreted . All posi
tions and all shapes are contained in space and bounded
by space , and if that which contains has no limit,
so will it
prove with the contained : if space be infinite,
so is matter .
2
Bruno
’
s certitude as to the Infinity of the Universe
was by no means accepted by his younger contemporaries
Galileo and Kepler . The latter, who refers to him by name,
inclined strongly towards the opposite view, perhaps for
religious reasons ;
3
the judicious Galileo wrote :
“ Reason
and my mental powers do not enable me to conceive of
either fi n i tud e or i n fi n i tude .
“ “ No one has proved the
world to
( be
finite and determinate or I nfinite and i n
determinate .

Bruno grasped the general principle of the relativity of
knowledge . In this work he demonstrates the relativity
of sense ;
in the Sp a cci o he will point out the relativity of
morals in De M i
'
n i
'
nte he will demonstrate that there is no
absolute measure for either time or space . But the asser
tion of the relativity of knowledge is obviously an assertion
which claims to be absolutely true knowledge . Bruno goes
further than such a claim, although , while it is an assured ,
it is by no means a modest one . The contradictions which
are involved in conceptual time and space were felt even
then . But Bruno unhesitatingly grasped one horn of the
dilemma : for him the other horn did not ex ist . In infinity,
thought out,
there is no measure, no proportion , no compre
hen s ible number,
”
he says .
1 Yet he has just argued from
mathematical conceptions to physical reality . Space is for
him an actu ally boundless continuity, an endless field for
the motion of an actually endless number of solar systems .
It is filled with the ether .
2 He writes of the
“ corporeal
infini te the simulacrum of the First Principle
” 3 as
actual
,
existent being . He distinguishes between the con
taining and the contained, between space as room to move
in ,
the condition for motion , and the ether which occupies
room ;
4
,,
but,
in positing an infinite ether a s aOCCll pyin g
infinite space, he clearly asserts absolute position in space,
or in the language of the generation preceding our own ,
that space is absolute . This question is under dispute .
5
He perceives that continuity is quite a different thing from

space . There are countless suns and an infinity of planets
which circle round their suns as our seven planets circle
round our sun .
” 1 Particles are incessantly S hot out through
space from each Ofthese worlds to other worlds and from
one body to another, bodies being a composition of these .
2
He tells us that each heavenly body, being animate,
moves by its own intimate energy . The moon is an earth ,
and our earth, seen from the moon, would appear a luminous
disc , as the moon does to us
“ It is not unreasonable to
suppose that there are planets which circle round other suns ,
not perceived by reason Ofgreat distance or small mass or
not much (
reflectin g) water on their surface .
” He speaks
of the World-Soul as an animal ,
the all-sustainer of worlds
which are souls and contain souls ,
some of which are higher,
some lower than we and there must be plants and minerals
in the worlds of space like those of our earth or differen t .
We can attribute life to worlds with better reason than we
can to our own earth.
” 3
He had the merit of perceiving that comets have a regular
course and are bodies not altogether different from the
planets .
4 Some of his speculations are very remarkable ;
they read like intuitive forecasts of modern discovery . Of
such are : The sun
’
s heat is produced by S imilar causes to
those which produce heat on earth ;
light emanates from
the atmosphere immediately surrounding the sun ;
5
the sun
has its own motion ; some of the suns may revolve, as
planets ,
round others ;
there are suns which cannot be seen
by reason of their great distance ;

bodies decay and give place,
in time,
to new formations ;
their particles are in constant motion ;
2 and the fixed stars
are really in motion .
3
He accounts for the phenomenon ofcohesion by the pre
sence of water .
4
Possibly the difficulty of accounting for the phenomena of
light
, heat and meteors was one of the reasons which i n
dIIced Bruno to adopt the theory of indecomposable atoms
or prime bodies of which all worlds are really made up .
These atoms are always in incessant movement, passing
from body to body and from world to world ;
they are for
ever entering or leaving some combination of themselves .
5
This reads almost like a dim prophecy of the discovery of
radio-activity ; and the disappearance of the ether ,
if not
temporary, will necessitate a very serious modification of
the undulatory theory of light .
A great part of the I nfi n i te is given over to vigorous
attack on Aristotle
’
s limited conceptions of the Universe .
Bruno
’
s arguments are acute, and many of them are de
s truc tl v e ; but they sound strange to-day : the work of
Galileo and Newton brushed them aside . Two of them may
serve for examples of the remainder . Aristotle had imagined
S pheres of water, air and fire surrounding the earth .
6 Bruno
points out that there is no evidence for the
'
existence of
these spheres . On the contrary,
the evidence is all the
other way ;
the elements are all mixed
'
up together ;
there
is air in the earth hot and cold springs prove the presence
of water in the rocks ; fire leaps forth from the mountains .

that heavy bodies move down ;
light bodies , up ;
therefore
there would be infinite lightness and infinite heaviness in
an infinite universe . Bruno shows that the phenomena of
upward and downward motion are determined by relations
of S ituation between bodies what appears to us as an
upward motion towards the moon would,
to an inhabitant
of the moon , appear a fall towards his own globe .
1 All this
is a
'
cutely argued, but Bruno
’
s cosmology is less reasoned
construction than leaps towards truth, many of them reach
ing it . The most powerfully logical mind may wander far
from truth : by innate disposition or education or habit or
prejudice it is apt to incline towards wrong paths . It was
Bruno
’
s strength that
,
in the main , he had an instinct as to
the right direction . An d it is to such an instinct that
success is most likely to fall . He was ahead of his time in
emphasiz ing the need of Observation and ex periment,
abstraction and comparison .

He retains a lively recollection of the Calvinists of Geneva
and other protestants he had come across . He has a word
to say on the doctrine OfPredestination and its moral effect .
In God,
S ince to make is the same as to be made,
free-will
and necessity are the same ; but for man they are partial ,
yet valid aspects . Theology is right in maintaining that
the will is free,
for man is not the same as God,
though
supported in His immanence . Men misconceive of absolute
truth . Antecedent determination is not basal truth . Frac
tically to will and to be free are one and the same, and man
possesses a measure of freedom .
3 The rude and ignorant
are wholly unable to understand election , dignity and the
merits of justice, whence predestination , filling them with
assurance or desperation ,
they become very vile . Whiles ,

having enjoyed youth for so many years, gave himself up
to Wild ramblings and took up all his time i n the affairs
of arms a n d love . But now, being tamed , he begins to
decline in his wantonness and vices and to lose the diver
sions and entertainments of youth and manhood . He
“ begins to advance in years and admits none unto his
council but such as have snowy heads and furrowed
brows those who have learned to be thoughtful
, prudent,
continent, forgetful of affronts , and have acquired general
,
practical wisdom .
2 “ Jove stands for each one of us
” 3
for every man is ultimate reality individualised as a
living spirit
, which rules over a microcosm ; and man
passes through a period of sensual enjoyment and passion
into years that bring the philOS Ophi c mind . But Jove
also represents the changes that take place in collective
humanity : he is the Z ei tgei s t . He swears a great oath
that virtue shall rei gn in heaven . The goddess of love
proposes a ball to celebrate the victory of the Gods over
the Titans ; but Jove resolves to hold a grand Council
of the Gods instead . These Olympian deities are our
good and evil qualities personified . Jupiter seats himself
on his throne and announces his determination

purge
the sky of its beastly impurities . The Constellations ,
such as the Bear,
the Dragon,
the

the Hydra, all
represent brutal vices and must be replaced by those
virtues which are their contraries . It S hould not be for

to co-0perate in determining the character and lives of

The assembled Gods ratify Jove
’
s decision , and the sky
is forthwith purged of its beasts and ancient signs ,
one
by one . Each is replaced , after much discussion, by the
symbol of some quality conducive to good behaviour . By
an adroit s
'
troke, Momus ,
the god of ridicule ,
is made to
act as jester to the Olympian Court, and Bruno is thus
able to get out a good deal not to be taken
“ too asser
tively.
”
Sometimes ,
too, he attracts attention to novel
thought by Momus
’
over-emphasis or exaggeration . Momus
is for ever jesting : he is the spirit that denies the critical
,
earnest S pirit speaking through the mask of mockery ;
there is something in him OfLucian and Voltaire, of Ibsen
and Shaw, even ; he is at once the spirit Ofhumour and
of dissatisfaction ; he is an inner illumination , observing
what progress is being made in reform and finding relief in
bitter jest .

A tumultuous throng of ideas surges to and fro to find
ex pression hence the allegory is not systematic or always
well sustained . Bruno

to each other and the contraries of the vices to be ex pelled ;

Rabelais would bore most readers but for his indecorum,
and no man could ever batter himself into the enjoyment of
those peculiar turns of thought and treatment which Bruno
takes : he must be born a Brun i an . The thinker
’
s torren
tial rush of ideas and words swerves hither and thither ; his
metaphors are often fantastic , whimsical
,
extravagant ; he
scorns moderation ; he knows not the meaning of reserve .
Not merely does he play on a thought with all possible
variations , but he splashes words about with the rich enjoy
ment of an urchin in a bath . That he piles words on words ,
all of similar meaning,
i s sometimes a trick of emphasis ,
sometimes because he is aware of the many facets presented
by every fact
, and desires to deliver himself of a complete
meaning. He never learned the lesson of simple directness
taught by Boccaccio, or tried to imitate the limpid flow of
Tasso
’
s prose . Worse still, he fell into a fashionable vice
of his time . Translating the classics directed men
’
s atten
tion to the power lying latent in every word ;
they dis
covered the richness ofmodern speech, and some of them
fell into the vulgar View that a sonorous and pompous
display of words is impressive, even when they are of
almost identical meaning . Bruno marshalled whole batta
lions ofineffective synonyms and was happy when he had
decorated an idea with
“ verbal ruffles and frills .
” He
would seem to have known that his style was apt to S prawl .
1
The Gods , after much humorous debate concerning each
holder of a constellation , who typifies certain human vices ,
eject him and seat corresponding virtues in his place . The
Little Bear, occupying the fix ed centre of the revolving sky,
has stood for Fa lsi ty, Hypocrisy and allied vices let Truth,
which follows R eality,
take his place and preside .
“ The ,
act of the Divine Knowledge is the substance of the being

which follows things ; but is before all things and is every

” 1 Since our Knowledge is imperfect,
then , we must
be careful how we give liberty to the vulgar to read what
they please and form their own

be allowed to be read by ignorant men , who would thereby

others .

that natural law by which every man 18 allowed to have as

; and he
supports this bold suggestion by the fallacious argument of
increasing population .
1 “ We call those virtues which by
a certain trick and custom are so called and believed ,
though their effects and fruits are condemned by all sense
and natural reason ;
such as open knavery and folly,
the
malignity of usurping laws and of possessors of meli m and
ta ll m; the strongest being the most rightful possessor,
and he being the most worthy who is most solicitous,
most industrious , and the first occupant of those gifts and
parts of the earth which Nature, and consequently God ,
gives to all indifferently .
” 2 We almost might be reading
modern propaga n da !
Here and there he drops in a Philosophical sentence .
There is an eternal Principle or S ubstance which is truly
the man and no accident derived from Composition . This
is the deity,
the hero,
the particular God,
the intelligence in ,
from and through whom different Complexes and bodies are
formed and form themselves ,
so that it continually re
appears in different species, names and fortunes .
” 3
The Soul
, which is the eternal basis and meaning of
souls , does not change and canno t become subject to
dissolution : but in body and experience there is nothing
but vicissitude .
4 God , considered absolutely, has nothing
to do with us , but only as he communicates himself by
the effects of Nature ,
to which he is more nearly allied
than Nature itself ;
so that if he is not Nature itself,
certainly he is the Nature of Nature and the Soul of
the World,
if he is not the very soul its elf.

of rule,
to the forcible suppression of all competing forms
of faith . Bruno valued Christianity above all reli gi ous
systems , because it proclaimed the doctrine of love : it was
a
“ religion , which began ,
increased and maintained itself
with the raising of the dead ,
the healing of the S ick and
self-s acrifi ce for others . Yet,
in some respects , he found
Paganism superior . It was more tolerant
, nearer to
Nature and he thought it had a profounder metaphysical
basis .
“ Those wise men knew that God was in things
and that the divinity lay hid in Nature,
shining and dis
covering itself differently in different subjects ,
and made
them partakers of itself.
” 1 “ From whence , with magical
and divine rites ,
they mounted by the same ladder of
Nature to the very height of the Divinity which descended
to the meanest and lowest thi ngs by the communication of
itself. But what I think most deplorable is that I see
some senseless and foolish idolaters , who no more imitate
the ex cellency of the Egyptian worship than the shadow
partakes of the nobility of the body, who look for Divinity,
without any manner of reason ,
in the excrements of dead
and inanimate things . And what is worse than all
this,
they triumph for joy to see their own foolish rites
in so much reputation , and those of others vanished and
annulled .
” 2 “ Divinity hath ,

if he had been the Divinity, but they worshipped the
Divinity as if i t
-had been in Jupiter for all the Gods
were once really
'
men , and
“ seeing excellent majesty ,
justice and magnanimity in a man ,
they presumed there
was a magnanimous just and bountiful God within him
or at least the Divinity which communicated itself in
s uCh a manner, by the name of Jupiter.
” 1 Bruno
’
s
religion was metaphysical and mystical he was so strongly
imbued with Neo-Platonic thought that he found himself in
sympathy with all kinds o f faith when philosophically inter
preted . But Catholic Christianity, which owed so much to
Neo-Platonising theologi ans i n the fifth an d sixth centuries
and to the systematiz ing of Alexandrian speculations by
the schoolmen, was further endeared to him by early edu
cation and habit ;
the authority of Rome had , until lately ,
been recognised in the political constitution and laws of
the great Western peoples whom it had welded into some
sort of union ;
so it had a strong claim on him as a
formal faith ; he was always willing to hand over to
theology the contemplation of the Divinity as transcending
the infinite universe,
2
if he might make an independen t
study of Nature , and freedom were allowed him to form
his own conclusions therefrom . But , as the field of know
ledge is enlarged,
the demesne of Theology is a pt to be
encroached on . The incompa tibility of systematic know
ledge with dogma is progressively discernible in Bruno
’
s
writings . Y et he thought adjustment within the Church
was possible,
if it would give a twist to its doctrines and
accept synthetic development . As a Catholic , he pours
scorn on irreconcilable Reformers with their new-fangled
dogmas and hide-bound forms . Especially does he re
probate those who hold to salvation by faith , despise
works, and think
“ doing good and abstaining from evil

does not render them acceptable to God ; but only hOpi ng
and believing according to their catechism .
” 1 “ Among
ten kinds of such
’
teachers there is not to be found
i
‘
one
who has not formed to himself a Catechism ready to be
published to the world,
if not published already, approv
in g no other institution but his own , finding in all others
something to be considered, disapproved or doubted of;
besides that the greater part of them disagree with them
selves , blotting out to-day what they had written yester
day.
” 2 Bruno was all for tolerance, but he perceived a
menace to society in every man , however ill￾qualifi ed he
might be, setting himself up as the sole possessor of
truth and endeavouring to coerce his fellows into sub
mission to his own opi ni on .
But if he despises Protestant sectaries , he is no less
severe on the defects of his own Church . He objects to
ecclesiastical authority setting up and enforcing rigid
dogmas which it either does not in the least understand or
which it misinterprets . The practical end of Religion S hould
not be burdened with subtle and valueless theological S pecu la
tions . Bruno is always as faithful to truth as the needle
to the pole ; heedless of personal advantage and even of
personal safety . He was ex pecting to go back at once
with Castelnau to a country which was suppressing all
freedom in religious thought and S peech when he put into
the mouth of Momus a scoffwhich is not hard to unriddle
the fate of the centaur Chiron is under debate— a bein g, he
says ,
“ in which one Person is made up of two Natures ,
and two substances concur in one hypostatical union .

priests of Diana should be less ready to exalt their office
and mysterious function .
1 Bruno was a Modernist of
the I 6th century ; he thought the Catholic position needed
revision and re-statement ;
those qualified to think freely
should be free to do so .
He believes neither in a universal deluge nor in the
recent creation of man .
2 He cannot credit that the various
races of men should have descended from a single pair ;
if
so,
it must have been by some miracle like that by which
Jonah had a marvellous voyage—
“ a handsome way of
transporting men by some blast of wind or some passage
of whales,
that have swallowed persons in one country and
gone to spue them alive in other parts and upon other
continents .
” 3 Such biblical miracles are absurd ,
as are
those of the saints , and much doctrine taught by the
Church . Momus declares that Orion ,
“ who can walk upon
the waves of the sea without sinking or wetting his feet
;
and consequently can likewise do a great many other pretty
tricks ,
”
shall be sent among men ,
“ and let us order him
to teach them everything which he pleases, making them
believe black is white and that human understanding, when
it thinks it sees best ,
is mere blindness, and that what
appears to R eason good, excellent and choice is base
wicked and ex tremely evil
;
that Nature is a whorish
baggage,
that Natural Law is knavery,
that Nature and
the Divinity cannot concur to the same good end ;
that the
justice of the one is not subordinate to the justice of the
other,
but are things as contrary to one another as light is
to darkness ;
that the entire Divinity is Mother of the
Greeks , and is like a hard stepmother to all other genera
tions , whence none can be acceptable to the Gods but by
becomi ng Greeks . For the greatest Russian or Poltroon
who lived in Greece, as being allied to the generation of

preferable in mann ers , sciences, valour,

and authority ; because these are natural gifts, and there

without labour and pains, and keeps the mind free from
melancholy
” 2 On e can hardly wonder, after reading this,
that Bruno should request not to be taken too assertively
”
and inform his reader that the personages in the book speak
S incerely, but in their own proper character .
3 None the less,
he exhibits considerable courage in such free criticism of what
was generally held sacrosanct in all Christian countries .
That he could do S O in England, and especially attack
Protestantism in a land which had at least broken away
from Rome,
testifies to the liberty she enjoyed .
Bruno satiriz es the belief in particular interventions of
Providence

without .
” 1
Give a blow, says Jupiter,
to all prophets, diviners,
fortune-tellers and prognosticators , and all such as traverse
and run about to spoil my progress .
” 2 He expresses con
tempt for
“ altars and statues erected to certain persons
whom I am ashamed to name, because they are worse than
our satyrs, fauns and other half-beasts— viler than even
the crocodiles of Egypt .
” 3 Bruno has a fling,
in turn , at
current Christianity, Judaism (
for some reason or other he
detested Jews),
4 and Mohammedanism : all are useful and
valid, but contain distortions of p
hilOS Ophi c truth .
He has no belief in a Garden of Eden or sweet Age of
Gold .
” He foreshadows our modern knowledge of the
evolution Ofhumanity : in the Golden Age men were not
more virtuous than the beasts at present are virtuous ; and
perhaps they were more stupid than many of the beasts .
” 5
But he derived this view from Lucretius .
Nor was this his sole indebtedness to the great Latin
poet . He adopted the theory of
“ atoms — imperishable
physical identities— which Lucretius drew through Epicurus
from Leucippus and Democritus . And the consideration
of physical individuals must have led him on to ponder,
if
he had not done so before, on the problem of individual
souls . Is there atomic personality From his first works
to his last
, he insists on the On e Soul of the World , which
is the unfolding of the Absolute to itself. But,
in and for
the Divine mind ,
there are centres of experience . In
every man,
in each individual a world,
a universe re
gards itself.
” 6
Is each centre of experience a permanent
,
inex haustible energy ! Are souls immortal, even as is

i t be not true, seems at least likely,
according to the opinion
OfPythagoras .
” 1 The answer is a riddle, which maybe
unravelled in more than one way . Here ,
in the Ex pul
sion ,
”
he suggests that Ifnot to be believed,
it is gravely
to be pondered whether a vile life be not disposed of by
fatal justice ,
interwoven in a prison -house suited to its
failure or crime, with organs and instruments suitable for
such a workman or craftsman .
” An d again : Let us sup
plicate the Divinity to bestowhappy geniuses upon us in
our transfusion , passage or metempsychosis since, how
ever inex orable he be, we must attend him with wishes ,
to be
either preserved in our present state or to enter into a better,
or a like, or one but a little worse he that is favoured
by the Gods must obtain this by means of good wishes and
good actions .
” 2
We may be sure that Bruno did not accept Pythagorean
doctrin e in a crude and vulgar form . He employs it,
just
as he employs Catholic dogma, not by way of dodge, but in
the sincere belief that various adumbrations of Truth must
be adapted to various grades of illumination . The result is
that his own inner meaning is lost in obscurity . Pytha
gorean i sm is far from removing that dread of Orcus and
greedy Charon which he had promised to take away .
3
But, co—operating with his Neo-Platonism and belief in
hidden sympathies in Nature, such facts as the re
appearance ofancestral qualities , vital similarities in widely
differing species, and i nnate tendencies would naturally lead
him on to vague speculation in order to ex plain them .

WORKS PRINTED IN LONDON 1 65
But so shrewd a thinker as Bruno must have perceived
that ,
if in some way individual centres of experience persist
in the Soul of the World ,
t hey can hardly be said to do so
for themselves . Ifthey endure as centres of energy they
do not retain a true memory-synthesis recurrent habits in
life are not equivalent to self-conscious recollection . In
dividual immortality loses its value if the soul has to pass
through the waters of forgetfulness .
1 But that
“ to be
”
is
“ to experience
” was not explicitly recognised by Bruno or
anyone before Berkeley wrote and it is quite possible that
he entertained the idea of centres of energy persisting within
the Absolute , and that these bear effects ,
though not
precise memories , of past incarnations . The question of
immortal souls will recur in connection with the great Latin
poems .
The fire ,
the intemperate vigour of his Southern nature
made him rejoice in the Bacchic rout of life and nature .
He is for ever insisting on the universality and value of
vicissitude . The Spa cci o commences :
“ Ifthere were no
change in bodies , no variety in matter and no vicissitude in
beings ,
there would be nothing agreeable , nothing good or
n othing pleasant . We see that pleasure and s a ti sfac
tion consist in nothing else but a certain passage, progress
or motion from one state to another .
’Tis certain that the
state of hunger is irksome and unpleasant
; and s atiety is a
state of sadness and dulness : but What is pleasing in any of
these is a change from one to another . «1 Labour pleases
us only a short time after the state of rest : and we find 110
pleasure in rest , but only a few minutes after the state of
weariness .
” 2
Political dissimulation was a prevailing vice in the 16th
century : Bruno as an Ambassador
’
s
“ gentleman
” must
1 Cfr. D ante ; P urg. xxvi ,

have had ample Opportunity for observing it at work . He
'
attacks it with vigour : You see what a pass the world is
reduced to by a custom which is become a proverb That
Governors are not obliged to keep faith .
” 1 Ne vertheless ,
“ even the Gods are forced to use it at times . For some
times Prudence hides the truth with her skirts in order to
escape blame and outrage .
” 2
t He thinks the hunting of game cruel : a S port worthy
only of butchers ;
“ the hunting-dog should be sent to
Corsica or England .
” 3 The Cup must be given to the
chief tippler in Germany, Where gluttony is regarded as
heroic virtue an d drunkenness as a quality of heaven .
”
The affected dignity of potentates in their dress and baubles
of rank is satiriz ed , but with a weaker hand than is usual
with our author .
4
This work , although addressed to Sidney, would ,
like the
others published in England ,
seem to have fallen flat . In
1633, however, a masque ,
the general idea and details of
which were based on the Spa cci o, was played before
Charles I and Henrietta Maria ;
5 and the Spa cci o may have
influenced Spenser in writing the Two Can toes of Muta
bili ti e .
” 6
Interest in Bruno was manifested by a little
group of English deists at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, and one of these,
supposed to be W. Morehead,
translated the Dialogues but not the Dedicatory Letter of
the Spa cci o. This translation keeps so closely to the
original and renders its involved style and redundant
language so exactly that I have availed myself of it in the

personage,
the Bishop of Casamarciano, an obscure little
place in Italy,
and commences with a satiric letter . This
is followed by a sonnet in praise of the ass :
“ Oh, holy

devotion , who alone can so perfect the heart that human
capacity and study may not improve it ! Thou dost not
employ the weary painstaking of any art or discovery, or of
study of the skies , where thou has built thy home . Ofwhat

Bruno has now given the motif of the work . The
dialogues which follow are filled with bitter irony and
merciless Satire,
interspers ed with very serious thought .
No one wielded a more incisive lash or knew better how
to apply it . Sometimes he becomes unduly violent ; but
Often, when he is girding with sardonic grin ,
it changes
into a laughing smile or takes on noble severity . His
object is to destroy the notion that ignorance and super
s ti tious belief and fear are requisite in true religion ; he
would away with the pretentious simplicity of pietists
and the empty mysticism,
stupidity, and obstinacy which
render religion synonymous with obscurantism . He shows
that Scripture has been misused to glorify ignorance ; as if
the world ,
that wonderful Open book, were not also the
work ofGod . He lashes the hypocrite . But ignorance is
by no means confined to the Church . It is to be found
among philosophers, Whether they be Pyrrhonists or
Aristotelians, and also among such as pin their blind
faith on authority. In fact
,
the As s is to be found every
where ;
i n the church ,
the cloister,
the law-courts ,
the
schools : Asi ni ty is as widespread as is the Soul of the
World . But true religion and true philosophy, must not
be confounded with foolish superstition or supi ne i gnorance .
There are three short dialogues . In the first Sa
’
ulino
reappears and holds lively talk with S eba s to and Coribante,
a pedant . In the second dialogue, which is in three parts,
a fresh [ interlocutor is introduced, one Onorio, who like
the heroes of Lucian and Apuleius , has been an ass and
endured much throughout many transformations . Once he
was in the service of a gardener and was wont to be
loaded with vegetables for Thebes
’ market ; he dragged
charcoal after this ;
then he became a steed of the Pegasus
type and served the gods in that happy region where is
the fountain which gushed forth when the hoof of the
I 70 GIORDANO BRU NO
steed struck earth and which Apollo consecrated to the
Muses . In the course of his metempsychoses he has
occupied the body of Aristotle himself! It is splendid
fooling ; and all that may impede the progress of human
knowledge is treated with withering scorn . The third
dialogue has only a few lines . A messenger from S ebas to
informs Saulino that his master
’
s wife is dead ; he must
act as her ex ecutor , and ,
therefore,
further discussion is
to be postponed ; moreover, Coribante has the gout and
Onorio has gone away to take the waters .
Bruno recurs again and again to Pythagoreanism .
S EB. DO you hold that the soul of man is substantially the
same as that of beasts and that the only difference is one
of form ! ONOR . That of man is the same in its specific
and generic essence with that of flies , oysters, plants, and
everything which lives , or has a soul : it is not matter,
which it possesses in a more or less lively way— there is a
thorough permeation of S pirit in itself. NOW,
the aforesaid
Spirit , by fate or providence, order or chance, unites itself
to this or that kind of body, and, by reason of difference
in structure or of members,
reaches different grades and
perfections of faculty and act . Hence,
that spirit or soul
,
which was in the spider , and possessed its industry,
claws
and members of a certain number, mass and shape , united
with human seed,
acquires another intelligence,
instruments ,
postures and deeds .
” 1 Just before, Onorio has declared
that,
from experience and memory, he knows the doctrine
of Pythagoras and the Druids as to metempsychosis to be
most assuredly true .
It will be noticed that ,
in the quotation given above ,
Bruno has observed the importance of organs to function .
In another i nteresting digression he points out the im
portant part played by the hand in giving man his position
1 Cabala, Di al . I I ,

finds that he has to observe the difficult regulation of re
maining silent . for the space of two years . Mercury takes
pity on the unhappy beast, bestows on him the gift of elo
quen c e and transforms him in to a dogmatic pedant . Be
at home with all, scamper about with all
,
be the brother of
all,
identify yourself with them,
rule them, be themselves .
” 1
The innocent beast is no such ass as not to want to know
something . Tell me, sir,
”
he asks , and help me a little .
Which holds the first rank , a man who has become a
donkey or a donkey tra n smogrifi ed into a man
Six years later Bruno informed his readers that he had
suppressed the As s of Cyllene , for it annoyed the vulgar,
and, on account of its sinister flavour, did not please the
Wise .

supplement .

the sentiment found a lower level
,
and by the
sixteenth century it had furnished a vast crowd of poetasters
and dilettanti with fashionable affectations . Yet,
in the
fifteenth century, Ben iv ieni
, Pico and others, and, at the
beginning of the sixteenth , Castiglioni, soared almost as
high as Plato on wing hardly less con fid en t.
1 But the usual
Petrarchistic sonneteer,
forced, artificial and absurd, was as
hateful to Bruno as the pedant, and not less foolishly dull .
He makes Tans illo,
the Petrarchist, his
'
chief interlocutor,
point out a new and sure way. The intellectual lover may,
by strenuous effort,
reach a comprehensive vision of Nature,
2
which is the very image, nay the presence of God ,
though
he may not reach that sense of direct union, which is pure
feeling, granted to Plotinus
3 and other mystics .
The work is one long hymn to intellectual beauty,
in
prose and verse . One feels the influence of the Ti ma us
and the vision of the Platonic soul moving about the same
in unchanging thought of the same .

he followed lines laid down in the Sy mpoii um and P ha a

In the introductory letter to Sidney, when writing con
cerning the constant transformation of all things , he
digresses to distinguish between those who declare accord

as to his own attitude towards current Christian doctrine .
As to my faith,

he says,
I hold it a most proper thing
to declare and affirm with theologians and those who are
concerned with the laws and institutions of the people in
their interpretation : just as I am not slack to affirm and

accept the sense of those, among the good and wise, who
speak according to reason .
” 1 That is to say, The religion
of a people, being part of its political constitution and laws
,
must be followed ; but the competent may subject it to
judicious criticism . This is a most important passage,
because , when tried by the Inquisi tion , we find Bruno
willing to accept the Church as a practical institution and
affirm its dogmas as adumbrations of truth, but resolutely
maintaining the freedom of philosophy to in t erpret them
and to pursue an independent course .
He did not write for the crowd however ;
2 nor about
social ethics as in the Spa cci o he will redeem the promise
he made therein ;
3
that work was but an introduction to
this . The intellectually disposed will discover no abiding
home in the transitory world of sense or in ordinary piety ;
only by the exercise of intellect, which is a divine passion ,
shall these find anchorage for the soul . Such as would
purify the will S prout wings to the soul they already
possess the divine spirit they seek after, and so are at once
the lover and the loved ; and their love S hall enable these
undaunted heroes to pass through suffering (which is no
other than a golden spur), become spectators of Infinite
Power and Act,
and be at one, not indeed with the inner
most being ofGod, but with God in the highest manifesta
tions of his mind .
5 The innermost being of God is not
reached, even by the mystic .
Bruno is the first thinker who based the soul
’
s duty to
itself on its own nature : not on external authority, but on
inner light .
6 He leaves theology to itself and is not here

and all is intermingled with observations alien to the pur
pose i n hand and even with personal reminiscences . But
obscurity charmed the
“ intellectuals
”
of the era ;
they
found no entertainment more agreeable or more mentally
stimulating than moral conundrums— the more quaint and
singular the better . Bruno certainly succeeds in reviving
any flagging of attention by change of interlocutors ,
brisk
and natural dialogue, surprise and unexpected digression .
He would have the service of the soul directed to
“ the
fountain of the Ideas,
the ocean of all truth and goodness .
”
The Infinite, being infinite, must be infinitely pursued .
” 1
The pursuit of Natural Knowledge is a m0st exquisite means
of endowing the human soul with an heroic temper . For
there are stages in the contemplation of the Divine Love
and Wisdom . But,
cast back into the body and bound by
the body,
the soul is not always in progress .
2
It must then
arouse itself and make a new intrepid attempt ; first through
desire ; next
, by attention ;
then by study, and lastly by
being filled with loving enthusiasm .
3 And though we can
never attain the divine i n fin i tud e of Power, Love and Know
ledge, we can share in its blessedness .
Bruno makes his start then with an impulse of intellectual
passion ,
and treats of the upward ascent which the intellect
must traverse to reach a right comprehension of God
manifest in Nature . He makes Ta ns illo utter an Apologi a
p ro v i ta sua
“ That which hath no splendour beyond
bodily charm is worthy only of that form of love which hath
the perpetuation of the race for its object . Methinks it is
piggish to enquire or bother about i t
'
. For mine own part,
I was never more infatuate about such matters than I am

hankered after and enjoyed .
” 2 “ But the wise hold all
mutable things as if they were not, and affirm them to be
vanity
” 3 Sense would live according to sensible things ,
after its own manner ; but there are other laws :
4 he who
would aim at the imperishable Object must rise, by heroic
effort, above matter and flesh and the transitory things of
earth .
5 —The fulness of knowledge must be united with a
burning passion for that which is both love and truth . The
desire to comprehend is the soul
’
s home—sickness which
causes it to soar aloft for true wisdom and joy ;
it does not
avoid, nay,
it voluntarily seeks the path of suffering, the
“ Gethsemane of the soul
,
” which shall lead it to true beauty
—the ultimate harmony and conformity of all things .
6
There are two kinds of ecstasy which may be reached by
the divinely transported there is the abstraction of passive
mystics , who , usually, are ignorant folk,
“ into whom t he
divine sense enters as it were into an empty room and
there are those who are filled with intellectual ardour, which
spurs them to constructive activity,
“ so that
, by rational
process,
the spirit becomes godlike in contact with its divine
object .
” “ The first kind p ossess more dignity
“
, power and
efficacy in themselves ;
the second kind a re worthier, more
powerful and efficacious and are divine . The first are
worthy as is the
‘
ass who bears the sacraments the second
are as a sacred thing .
” 7 The experience
,
of the mystic has
empirical value, but philosophy deals with the rational .

s lute . He pursued them with the passion of a
lover . He holds that when
'
once intellectual love is aroused
nothing else will really satisfy.
1 We are indeed bound to
the body, and restricted by our vegetative life ; but our
proper activity is,
in ceaseless strife,
to contemplate the
divine object, whereby we shall bear even the most terrible
of life
’
s evils with unshaken mind .
2 Sensible beauty alters
and fades ; but there is an intelligible beauty which cannot
perish : Love inspires us with love to pursue it . The desire
of the soul is an infinite one, and this is of itself an assur
ance of i ts own unending fulfilment . The soul which has
touched its shining goal holds eternity in a moment . Man
“ becomes a god through intellectual contact with that
transcendent object
, and has no thought but of divme things
and shows himself insensible and unmoved by that which
ordinary men feel most of all but,
through love of the divine,
he disdai ns all other enjoyments and takes no thought of
life .
” 3 These are no mere words . Bruno proved that they
were S incere throughout life and in death .
“ It is neither
natural nor ex pedient that the infinite should be grasped,
nor can it render itself as finite,
for then it would cease to
be infinite ; but it is ex pedient and natural that the infinite,
being such ,
should be infinitely pursued ;
in which mode Of
seeking , not by physical desire, but by thought,
the im
perfect is not to be deemed the perfect, but, circling upwards
through the grades of imperfection , strains after that infinite
centre which is neither formed nor forms .

Sidney in the dedicatory letter ofthe Expulsion, must by
no means be taken a n pi ed de la lettre.

The heroic soul
,
says Bruno,
shall seek truth and find it .
The time had not then \
come for Pilate
’
s question to be put
again . Bruno was happily unvexed by the problem of
truth . No germ is to be discovered in any of his writings
of any one of the three popular solutions which philosophy
has since provided— that Truth is a copy of Reality, or
constitutes Reality itself, or is a mere sign for practical
life . He takes Truth quite simply and uncritically . But
there is a view implicit in the Eroi ci and in all but the
earliest of his philosophical writings , and this is that our
truth is a progressive,
ideal approximation towards that
whole Truth which is one with the inmost nature of
Being .
HOffdi n g justly remarks that,
in this work ,
complexity
of feeling is taken as a criterion for its development .
2 As
to the eternal striving of the Infinite, Bruno anticipates
Kant and Fichte . The interest he took in physics peeps
out even in this ethical rhapsody : he points to the ex pan
sive force of steam .
3
There are ex cellent remarks on poetry . Poetry is not
born in rules ,
”
says Tan s illo ;
“ rules are deri ved from
poetry ;
and there are as many sorts of true rules as
there are of true poets .

“ But how are true

IN PARIS AGAIN. S OME NEW WORKS
BEHOLD Bruno landed in France in as bad plight as ever,
or worse ;
robbed, homeless , his whilom patron no longer
able to help or protect him and with no prospect of better
things . Like Dante he was a wanderer, almost a beggar,
”
and like Dante he might have exclaimed :
“ Verily have I
been as a ship without sail or rudder, drifted hither and
thither on different refuges,
straits and shores by the bitter
blast,
the breath of which is wretched poverty .
” 1
“ I accompanied the Ambassador to Paris , where I stayed
another year
”
(more exactly seven months)
boarding and
lodging with the gentlemen I knew there ,
the greater part
of the time at my own expense .
” 2 We may suppose that
he was given food and shelter until he found employment .
How he supported himself we do not know ; he may have
had a little money about him probably he taught ; he may
have read proofs . He dwelt near the College of Cambrai .
3
It may be, as Tocco suggests ,
4
that he was weary of
persecution and wished to pursue his s
tudies under the
protection of some great dignitary . So , he would be able
to teach unmolested . But,
to this end it was necessary for
him to reconcile himself with the Church , which he had
never abandoned at heart . He had become an outlaw, a
reprobate, a child of darkness . So he went boldly to

Mendoz a, who was now Spanish Ambassador at Paris , and
who therefore represented the ruler of his nati v e province .
He judged ill of Mendoz a
’
s character : the Ambassador
identified himself wholly with the interests of his Church
and country, was mostly indifferent to all else,
and was
entirely unscrupulous i n the pursuit of the ends he set
before him . Bruno said to his judges :
“ I approached the
French Nuncio, Monsi gnor the Bishop of Bergamo,
to whom
I was introduced by Don Bernardino de Mendoz a, whom I
had known at the English Court .
” 1 “ Whilst I strove by
means [
of these gentlemen]to return to the Church ,
I con
s ulted another Jesuit ; and they told me that they could not
absolve me of apostasy and that I could not attend the
divine offi ces .
” 2 “ I prayed the Nuncio and sought again
earnestly that he would write to His Beatitude, Six tus V,
at Rome,
to obtain his grace and be received into the bosom
of the Catholic Church , but that I should not be compelled
to return to monkdom . Wherefore the Nuncio had no hOpe
and would not write unless I were willing to return to my
order . He referred me to the Jesuit father, Alonz o Spag
n uolo. I discussed my case with him, and he shewed me
that it was necessary to procure absolution from censure
from the Pope, and that nothing could be done unless I
went back to my order . I was further warned by him that,
being excommunicate, I could not attend the divine offi ces ,
but might very well listen to sermons and say my prayers
in Church .
” 3
Like Erasmus,
like More, he hoped that in the ferment of
new thought,
in the clash of ancient dogma with the new
passion for reason ,
the real government of the Church
would prove sagacious and institute some modus v i vena
’
i
for the genuine thinker ; as if the principle of authority
could ever be harmoniz ed with intellectual freedom ' He

cion s, painstaking and somewhat dull person , comes Bruno
bursting with self-con fidence, naturally vain , conscious
' of
not having received his due , and,
therefore, a trifle self
assertive and even boastful . The carelessness,
too, which
marked the Nolan
’
s style was present in his speech . What
he has to say is of so much importance that he must out
with it, whether the occasion be opportune and the bearer
prepared to receive it or no . Moreover, he is loftily con
temptuous of all who have not reached his own large
purview . The man
“ subdued to what he worked in is
Obviously interested at first in Bruno , but soon the idio
s yn c ra s i es of his visitor begin to irritate him . There is
not a word
'
Ofcomment
, but a diary always has selected
facts, and the facts recounted here are their own comment ;
we can read between the lines how little inclination two . so
diverse men discover for one another ;
they become a little
cool relations are a little strained, and , finally, cease .
At the first meeting we find Bruno telling that he has
lectured at Oxford ; he is about to print a
“ Tree of
Philosophers,
” 1 a work which certainly never appeared
from the Press during the author
’
s lifetime, but may be
the
“ An imadv e rs i on es
” 2 of which the manuscript is at
Erlangen . We learn that Bruno
’
s father is still alive at
Nola ; he is himself lodging near the College of Cambrai .
Further conversation turns on an edition of Lucretius .
Bruno comes again the very next day (Dec . 7th), perhaps
to consult books, and recounts some passages in his history,
of which I have made use .
“ He says he understands and
could explain in an hour artificial memory,
like that s et

1 This
is a remark very characteristic of the hero of our theme .
The few Latin words may indicate ,
so precise i s our autho
rity,
that Bruno dropped from French into Latin . Per
chance,
like most Italians , he did not speak it too well
,
and this may account for certain erasures and hiatuses in
the manuscript . There follows the usual intrepid expres
sion of most intimate opinion , and this to a stranger on the
second day of their intercourse ! He contemns the subtle
ties of the S choolmen and doctrines concerning the sacra
ments, even that of the Eucharist, which he says St . Peter
and St . Paul were un acquainted with, only knowing that
this is my body .
’ He says that with the removal of these
questions religious turmoil would disappear, and hopes that
will soon
'
be the end of it . But above all he detests the
heretics of France and England because they despise good
Works and preach the assurance of their faith and jus tifi ca
tion for Christian ity tends wholly towards life well spent .
He scorns Cajetan us and Pico della Mirandola and the
whole philosophy of the J esuits outside the subject-matter
and intelligence of Aristotle .
”
(Perhaps his unsatisfactory
interview with Father Alonz o Spagnuolo may have in teris i
fi ed his intellectual contempt for the Jesuits . ) Next comes
a side-light on the interest he took in Na tUral Science .
He told me much concerning the geography and cold of
Tartary and Scotland and of the temperature of Ireland
”
Concerning this last, he may have
“ learned the same
from con sul tacion s with some of Eliz abeth

says all the teachers of humane
letters in Italy are nobodies and unprofitable, but they make
money as private tutors to the children of nobles . Muret

its value, for teaching the nephew of Cardinal Colonna .
1
2 000 or 3000 would be bestowed freely on the education
of children .
” Cotin must have led the conversation on

others . Pa nigarola is without insight and futile Fiamma
has gone off in his old age

:

“ He strongly disparages Toledo

measures meted out to his turbulent nobles by the New
Pope,
S ixtus V. He took the side of the nobles .
Bruno calls again on the 2 1 s t and tells about his early
success in demonstrating artificial memory to the Pope .

Physics Of Aristotle
” 1 was printed by Pierre Chev illot,
who dwelt under the sign of the Red Rose,
in 1 5
86, and
was dedicated to Pierre d
’Albigny, Abbot of Belleville . He
compliments the Abbot on being specially well acquainted
with Aristotle and knowing what he talks about , while
professed peripatetics do not understand their master . All
possible arguments in favour of his views ought to be
presented before they are censured . The work is in two
parts ;
the first of these contains a synopsis of the main
conceptions of the P hy si cs under 1 5 mnemonic images ,
such as Apollo, Minerva etc . the second part is a sum
mary, not invariably correct, of the teaching of the same
work and of minor treatises ,
either by Aristotle or attributed
to him at that time .
We saw in the Diary how full Bruno was of Mordente,
who came from a place not so far distant from his own
beloved Nola . He must have rejoiced at meeting one who
was ,
like himself, a
“ servant and interpreter of Nature,
”
with a common interest in applied mathematics and possess
i ng the additional attraction Ofbeing a Neapolitan: Mor
dente
’
s mathematics were of no lasting importance ; he had
invented a new form of compass of no great value, and
would seem to have had some worthless ideas on i ncom
mensurable quantities at a time when men were feeling their
way blindly towards the discovery of new calculi . Bruno got
Chev illot to print Two Dialogues Of Fabri z io Mordente
OfSalerno,
” 2 with which was united a Dream .
” 3
In this
work Bruno,
to whom moderation was little better than a
vice,
loads Mordente with ex travagant,
if generous, praise :
“ The geometers, of the future shall raise him to the heavens
and give to his house and the S alern i an sky, with its limpid

” Let us believe
that the god among geometers
1 had some wider empire
of thought than is indicated by oblivion .
2 Bruno was always
ready enough to break away from the current worship of
antiquity to the admiration of modern men ,
and it would
seem that he got impres s edi
through his intercourse with
Mordente,
3 by two facts : that no quantity, however small
,
is negligible in calculation and that the concep t of a mini
mum is relative i n such wise that an instrument used for
taking the altitude of the stars may i nvolv e a minimum greater
than the whole diameter of the earth . He also learned
from Mordente that the same kind of reasoning is appli
cable to fractions as to whole numbers , and that in physical
investigations the indefinite regress must halt at a minimum
— propositions which he was to develop later on . The
dialogues between Mordente and Bottero turn on the Physics
of Aristotle and are condensed, dispersed and dry.
In the Dream there is obscurely revealed to Bruno a
triangular instrument for determining degrees of latitude .
He would seem to have had some dim foresight of i n s tru
ments which were not then invented .

summary of the arguments before them . There are only
twenty pages . First comes a dedicatory address to Henry
III and then an epistle to Files ac,
the Rector of the Uni ver
s i ty,
in which Bruno ex presses,
in warm terms, his sense of
the hospitality and kindness he h ad received at the Univer
s i ty . He informs File s ac that he is about to leave Paris .
Theses attacking the Aristotelian Physics and Cosmogony
follow .
Coti n
’
s diary furnishes us with much needed information
concerning the debate . He heard a somewhat coloured
account of Bruno
’
s misadventure at Geneva from one John
Vincent on March 2 0th, which he carefully sets down ,
and
the next reference to Bruno is as follows : 2 8th and 2 91h
May, which were the Wednesday and Thursday of Pente
cost , Jorda nus invited the Royal Lecturers and everyone to
hear him inveigh against seven (
s i c)
errors of Aristotle at
Cambrai . At the end of the lesson or oration he bade
defiance, urging anyone who might wish to do so to defend
Aristotle or attack Brun us , and, no one having come for
ward , he shouted still louder, as having gained the victory.
Then a young advocate, Rodolphus Caleri us ,
rose and,
in
a lengthy S peech , defended Aristotle against the aspersions
of Brun us , beginning by saying that the professors were
S ilent because they did not deem Brunus worthy of a reply
finally, he called on Brun us to reply and defend himself,
who was silent and left . The students caught hold of
Brun us ,
saying that they would not let him go unless he
replied or withdrew the calumnies he had cast on Aristotle .
Nevertheless, ultimately, he escaped from their hands , I
know not if on condition that he S hould return next day to
reply to the advocate . The advocate, having summoned an
assembly for the next day by placards , got into the pulpit
and followed up the defence of Aristotle and the jugglings
of Brunus in fine style,
still calling on him to answer . But

unfriends had
'
not been idle, either among professors or
students . Liberty to philosophiz e freely was insecure! at
Paris, and the eighth war Ofreligion was at hand . Indeed
Bruno was on the point of leaving Paris on account of
disorders
1
’ when the disputation took place .
We may suppose that there was tension in the air when,
according to custom,
the pupil, John Hen nequi n ,
took the
big chair to read Bruno
’
s theses , while their author, as
moderator,
took a lower seat . Hen nequi n must have been
a lad of courage to take up a cudgel for his master
’
s and
for truth
’
s sake against every astronomer and ma thema
ti ci an of his age . He belonged to a great family, nicknamed
“ the big
-pots .
” 2 The glib young Gascon , Raoal Callier,
who started the fray, might have been just the kind of im
pertinent youth to make a successful advocate had he not
abandoned the law for the better prospects of courtly office .
He was related to Rapin ,
the poet-scholar.
Man is a combative animal
, and the students of Paris
were as keenly interested in an intellectual fencing-bout as
were the ancients in the palee s trum, our Georgians in a cock
fight, or the youth of our own day in the athletic field . We
can imagine the crowded hall
;
the seniors sardonically
restless , only half-attending to the new doctrine ;
the youths
full of the ebullient prejudice which always accompanies
ignorance and is ready to demonstrate its force by noise .
The behaviour of the Professors , so different from their
former entreatmen t of Bruno , disgusts him, and it would
have been below his dignity, as a former professor,
to reply
to Callier. The students have an opportunity to begin a
rag,
”
and carry it out to their entire satisfaction . After
the manner sanctioned by its antiquity,
they were wont to

;
1 but on this occasion they surpassed themselves .
For Aristotle
’
s science had been attacked ; and therefore
they were insulted as Christians . I have not taught in
direct opposition to the Catholic R eligion ,
” Bruno told the
Inquisitors, but I was judged to do so indirectly at Paris ,
where I was permitted to engage in a di sputati
p
n under the
title of 1 2 0 articles against the Peripatetics
’
and other
popular philosophers, printed by permission of the Heads .
” 2
Latitudinarian England had proved itself indifferent to
the new science ; Calvinistic Geneva had persecuted its
apostle, and now Catholic France definitely rejected his
theses before considering them, not without show of physical
violence . He had resolved to leave disturbed France and
try his fortunes elsewhere before that unhappy end to the
disputation .
3 Shall he seek some generous asylum in
Germany, Catholic or Protestant !
The intrepidity of the traveller in the sixteenth century
was indeed admirable . He hardly noticed discomfort
'
and
he despised danger . Everywhere he had to run the risk of
plague, ague, smallpox,
treacherous landlords and wayside
murder. In Germany he was usually called upon to share
his bed with dirty, disagreeable wanderers ; all classes sat
together at the common table, and filthy fingers fished in
the common bowl for the choicest pieces . Vermin were
a matter of course .
4 Yet there was no lack of company .
Courtiers and scholars, monks and merchants, serving-men
and mendicants trooped all over Western Europe and jostled

founded 59 years before (

by Philip the Landgrave .
Here surely he would be welcomed ;
for not only was it the
first German university to be established by a prince and
independently of papal privileges, but at this time it was under
the protection and patronage of William the Wise , Land
grave of Hesse-Cassel . German universities usually re
fl ec ted the fanaticism, moderation or policy of the reigning
prince .
1 William was a man of independent mind and
interested in Astronomy .
2 Much might be hoped for . How
much of that hOpe was fulfilled remains recorded in the
rolls of Marburg students .
‘ Petrus Nigidi us , Rector of the
University, wrote therein : Jordanus Nolanus Neapoli tanus ,
Doctor in Roman Theology, 2 5 July, year 86 . The right
of teaching philosophy in public having, for weighty reasons ,
been refused to him by me with the consent of the rest of
the Philosophic Faculty, he blaz ed forth and insulted me in
my house,
as though I had acted in this matter contrary to
the law of nations,
the usages of German Universities and
every ex ercise of the Humanities . And, on that account,
he refused to remain a member of the University. His
desire was readily granted and his name erased from the
university-roll .
” 3
In a letter to the University of Witten
berg Bruno complains of having been restrained from lectur
ing publicly : a right recognised and used by all nations .
4
Marburg was too fiercely Protestant to li
'
sten to one who
inscribed himself doctor in Roman theology.
”
It had been
the scene of the famous
“ Colloquy
”
or contest between
Luther, Z wingli
, Melan cthon and other theological experts
concerning transubstan tiation.

At some later time the name,
through which Nigidius ran
his pen , was restored,
and the words with the consent of
the rest of the PhilOS Ophi c Faculty
” were crossed out .
Probably the unfortunate wanderer was induced to try for
better fortune at Wittenberg by the fact that a Neapolitan
whom he had known in England— no other than Alberico
Gentile,
the jurist— was now lecturing there . He gave me
his support, says Bruno, and introduced me
\
to lecture on
the Organon of Aristotle .
” 1 Bruno had arrived at a seat
of learning which, at this time, gave more liberty to philo
sophical discussion than any other ; and students from all
parts of Europe,
including many Catholics ,
especially young
Austrian noblemen and Poles, were to be found Studying
there .
2 The professors received him cordially, and he was
allowed to take private pupils on accoun t of his poverty.
Such a welcome,
following on the one he got at Marburg,
filled him with gratitude, which, after he had resided about
a year in the city, he expressed with dignity, yet not with
out an undertone of pathos .
3
In I 5 87 he printed an enlarged
and improved edition of his
“ Compendious Architecture,
issued to the world five years before . This is entitled
“ The
Lullian Combination-Lamp ,
”
and is dedicated to the senate
of the University. You have received and maintained me,
”
he writes,
“ you have dealt kindly With me up to this d ay.

France, undistinguished by any royal recommendation ,

private school or ordinary guild of scholars, and as my very
own .
” He names professor after professor, among them
Gri
‘
m, who held that theology cannot stand apart from
metaphysic,
1 with accompanying remarks of respect and
even of admiration .
The University, which later on was incorporated with
Halle , was founded in 1 502 , and had been the abode of
Luther, who spent half his days there and who,
like Bruno
now,
lectured on the
‘ Organon
’
as well as on Dialectic ,
and later, on theology . Bruno never before breathed so
free an atmosphere as Wittenberg had generally enjoyed
since Luther
’
s days up to those when he first came there :
there was no small measure of such religious toleration and
philOS Ophic liberty as the sixteenth century understood .
For a brief space ,
”
sang Pindar,
“ hath Opportunity for
men but of him it is known surely when it cometh and he
waiteth thereon, a servant but no slave .
” 2
In his official
capacity the new professor would seem to have lectured on
Rhetoric among other subjects ;
for what is supposed to be
the notes of his teaching— a summary of the Ad Alexa ndrum,
falsely ascribed to Aristotle,
together with outlines of argu
ments and synonyms to be used by speakers— was printed
by
John Henry Alsted , who acquired them in The

the second

In the same year appeared a much more important work
entitled B. Nela n i Camoera censi s Acroti smus seu ra ti ones

and the Ac roti smus is an attack on his cosmo
logy . But Acroti smus conveys a double, perhaps a triple
signification : it shows that Bruno possessed far more than
the little Greek indicated in the
“ As h Wednesday Supper .
”
Axp
or i
iq and a lepou-rm are also words used by Aristotle ;
the first means an extremity, a height or summit ;
the
second, one who comes to hear a discourse .
1
In fact the
Acroti smus is a reprint Of the
“ Hundred An d Twenty

” with the addition of the defence of them intended
to have been made at the College of Cambrai . Camoera

work might be freely translated as
“ The Cosmology of

arguments of articles on physics against the Peripa
teti c s .
” 3
The work Opens with a letter to the Parisians and other
philosoph ers of the most generous Kin gdom of France and
to friends and defenders of the philosophy of direct per
c eption . Probably Bruno had not learned that Hen ry
announced on January I s t that he did not intend to Observe

I t was Bruno
’
s habit to employ a pupil as copyist . In
the Augustan Library at Erlangen there ex is t two codices
of Aristotle

s Physics explained .
” 1 On e of these i s i n an
unknown handwriting ;
the other was written later by
Besler, of whom more anon . This work, with all
”
other
manuscript treatises by Bruno , has been published recently
at the charge of the Italian people .
2 Vitelli thinks it is the
substance of lectures given at Wittenberg, but S tOltz le and
Tocco believe it to belong to the period when he lectured at
Paris .
3 Bruno introduces a good deal of his own teaching
into this tractate, which deals with Aristotle
’
s Physics ,
Generation An d Corruption and a part of his Meteor
ology.
”
He also dictated a still more important work at Witten
berg,
“ The Lamp OfThi rty S tat ueS
,
" 4 of which there is at
Erlangen both an earlier and a later and less correct copy,
the latter done by Besler at Padua . This Lamp
”
is
referred to in a work which was published at Prague in
I 5 8 8
5 as the Lampas Ca ba lli s ti ca ,
” The C a balli s ti c
Lamp,
” “ a work to appear shortly

; but it has only been
printed recently . It is a logical and mnemonic work , some
what on Lullian lines and not barren of Neo-Platonic S pecu
lation . It was intended to provide an instrument for the
discovery of truth ;
the arrangement and much of the
thought in it appears mechanical and artificial to the modern
reader, but its fantastic types,
”
images etc . were caleu
lated to popularise it at the time . The author avails himself
of Aristotelian conceptions ; but it is Obvious that he is

'
we read that the individual
is as a spark of the Universal Spirit,
from which he issues
and to which he returns .
2 But while God, as absolute ,
works in and through us , He does not impart Himself to
us in His most innermost nature .
3
Intellect is not a mere
function of animal organs .
4
Incidentally, Will is treated
of. There are grades of volition ; material
,
composite and
spiritual varieties may be distinguished,
5
the latter being
free from matter and wholly intelligible . Evil is necessary,
being the complement of good : without it, good could not
be .
3 The perfection of the Whole depends on the perfection
of its parts in relation to itself, and it is greater than they .
7
It is noteworthy that he accepts the divine mission of Christ ,
the Son of God, sent
“ to raise us up from brutality and
barbarism to the practice of love .
” 3 He often writes in a
way to which no orthodox Roman Catholic could possibly
take exception , but it is clear that he S incerely believed the
Church to need purgation from superstitions and that its
doctrines may legitimately receive metaphysical interpreta
tion from the wise . Here, as whenever he treats of religion
as more than a means of preserving social order and stability,
he would substitute the milk of reverence and the bread of
philosophy for the fiery distillations of dogma, whether
Catholic or Protestant . He accepts much that is mi racu
lous
”
;
for all is miracle, and superstitious people are im
pressed chiefly by that which is not yet understood . But
the Essence of Christianity lies in Love or in nothing , and
this has been forgotten .

To this period also belongs a dictated manuscript, pre

It is entitled “ Observations Concerning The Lullian

Albums would seem to have been as fashionable among
reverential scholars in the sixteenth century as among

to a certain Hans von Warnsdorf,
is preserved in the

entry in Bruno

for the first time,
the hospi
tality of a German Uni versity which ,
in spite of its beer and
groaning tables, was really alive, and he might exercise
true philosophic liberty
2
there . Like Pius II, he revised
his judgment,
3
recognised the merit of existing German
achievement and declared that, when Germans should cease
to waste their energies on theologic futilities, directing
themselves to saner thinking,
they
“ would become, not
men , but Gods . Indeed extraordinary latitude was extended
to B runo,
for, as he says, he proclaimed certain doctrines
which uprooted the received teaching of centuries , and
by no means kept to science as accepted by theology .
But a storm was gathering, although the University still
continued an unusual toleration of Opinions Opposed to
those considered to be
“ right .
”
In I 5 80 the Lutherans of Germany issued the famous
Formula of Concord,
”
popularly known as that of Discord .
For there was a subtle undercurrent of Calvinistic Opposi
tion , and Philippists maintained the broader-minded prin
ciples of Philip Melancthon with customary intolerance of
any other . The Elector Augustus of Saxony died in
February of the year of Bruno’
s arrival and was suc
ceed ed by his son , Christian I , a prince who succumbed
in a S hort time,
like so many German rulers of his time,
to drink . Christian
’
s brother-i n -law, John Casimir, regent
of the Palatine Lines, was busy coercing his own
’
wife and
his people into Calvinism, and this naturally aroused the
indignation of Saxon Lutherans .

He exalted such Germans as Albertus Magnus ,
Paracelsus and the Landegrave William of Hesse, patron
of Copernicus . OfCusanus , he said that he would have
equalled Pythagoras had not his genius been stifled under
priestly garments . In the city of Luther some eulogy of
the great Reformer was expected . While the dogmas of
the warring sects repelled Bruno, he admired Luther for
protesting against ecclesiastical tyranny and rejecting
fetters for the soul forged at priestly smithies .
“ But
whom, said he,
“ have we passed by ! The mighty hero
who resisted the voracious monster, half-fox , half-lion that
vicar of the princes of Hell who polluted the world by
Craft and force and cajoled men into superstitious and
uncouth worship under the disguise of divine knowledge
and the S implicity which is acceptable to God . Whence
comes he From Germany,
from the banks of the Elbe .
Out of the darkness of Orcus your Hercules dragged forth
the monster with the triple crown, bursting open the steely
gates of Hell
,
triumphing over the city guarded by triple
walls and the nine-fold stream of Styx . Thou hast seen
the light, 0 Luther ;
thou hast regarded it ;
thou hast heard
the awakening spirit of the Lord and hast obeyed it ;
thou
hast confronted and overcome the adversary girt about
with power,
and thou hast despoiled him .

now said, added to what appeared later in a Latin poem,
3
was probably the chief cause of the curious impression
that by the

” 1 Probably the farewell declamation affected his
treatment at the hands of the In quisition .
It would have been churlish in one who had been allowed
to teach strange doctrine in the cradle of Lutheranism, with
out any enquiry being made into his own religious faith, had
he abstained from some recognition of Luther as a libera t
ing force and the enemy of ecclesiastical abuse . But Bruno
confined himself to no conventional homage ; he knew no
mean ; he expressed his gratitude in pa s sion atBpraise of a
man with whose opinions he had less of sympathy than of
disagreement While he regarded Luther as right in break
ing up abuses , he was far from admiring Lutheranism . He
considered the reformers to be men more ignorant than him
self.

merely repeated the compliments he had already paid the
University .

With the praises of the Arch foe of Rome still hot in his
mouth, he se t forth confidently for Prague,
the capital of a

But he was no Lutheran ; he deemed himself a Catholic,
justly asserting the right to , read profound esoteric doc
trines into the dogmas of his Church .

THE University at Prague, however, had maintained more
or less liberal traditions during its two centuries Ofexist
ence ; and, although reaction was afoot, by far the greater
number of the people of Bohemia were Protestants of one
kind or another ; nor had the Jesuits yet got the upper
hand . But the city had lost much of its privileged liberty,
and was just sufficiently a place of compromise to serve as
a residence for the Emperor Rudolf II . He had achieved
the Bohemian crown In I 575 by merely pledging his kingly
word to introduce a comprehensive Confession which should
prove satisfactory to the whole Bohemian people — a
superhuman undertaking which was never fulfilled . Yet
,
although the Catholics in power were gradually forcing the
Protestants back into the Roman Church ,
there was pro
visional peace, and therefore the visit of Bruno to Prague
was less dangerous than might appear . There was,
indeed,
more than one reason why . he directed his steps thither .
R udolf might
, perhaps, have been considered a widely
cultivated man had he not chanced to be born a prince .
He affected every known branch of knowledge and posed
as its patron . His s c1entific and artistic collections were
magnificent . The melancholy which oppressed his later
years manifested itself at this time only in S hynes s and
singular behaviour“ He wasted much time over horoscopes
and the s earch
'for the philosopher
’
s stone but his interest
in the perversions of science, which attracted Dr. Dee and

of Georgius Dacz enus a work dedicated to the Emperor, and
entitled On e Hundred And Sixty Articles Directed Against
The Mathematicians And Philosophers OfThe Day .
” 1 The
dedication is lofty and bold . He tells Rudolf that he looks
forward to a religion of love which shall be no cause of con
trov ersy and above dispute, being the desi re
'ofthe soul and
required by the reasonable covenants of the nation and of
society . He protests against conflicting sects and i ntoler
ance of every kind . But he did not limit Opprobrium to those
who,
to use the words of a modern seer, are wont to vilify
the sun because it will not light their cigar,
”
for he detested
still more those who
“ enforce their own prejudices with
fire and sword .
” Bruno
’
s ideal was the transformation of
Catholic Christianity, purged of parasitic absurdities,
into
a true progressive religion . He had not the knowledge or
interest to criticiz e Christianity ; but he saw how “ authority
usually binds and deceives in countless ways and that the
thinker must set himself free from subjection to any other
mind .
” 2 “ It is sheer prejudice to settle a matter with small
consideration it is an evil deed to follow obsequiously the
lead of another man ;
corrupt, slavish and traitorous to the
dignity of free men to consent and surrender ; wholly stupid
to believe because of wont and usage ; and imbecile to
assent to the Opinion of the mob .
” We wish this law to
be vigorously observed,
that reason is as true as it is
necessary, and the authority of no men , howsoever true and
excellent persons they may be,
is admissible as an argu
ment .
” “ Thus do we go forth to the most delightful
splendour of light, understand Nature (which is cryi ng aloud
to be heard)
a nd follow wisdom (which we hold supreme
above all
) with singleness of spirit and an honest heart .

speaks of a new spirit which shall animate the future . Of
himself he says :
“ In the free field of philosophy I shall
shelter me from the ever-moving flood and seek the society
of them that open their eyelids .
" He asserts with the
Kantists that all measure is determined by the prior measure
of mind ; and we seem to be listening to Descartes when
we are told that
“ everything, however men may deem it
assured and evident, proves, when it is broug
ht under dis
c us sion,
to be no less doubtful than are extravagant and
absurd beliefs .
” 1
A brief introduction follows the dedication, and then come
160 articles and 1 80 constructions whi ch
‘
are but bare out
lines of much which Bruno dealt with later in the De
M i uimo and De M ona de. One object of the articles was
to show that the propositions of Euclid can be intuited in
three figures . Bruno
’
s mathematics are crude and fallacious ,
but they have never received the attention of a capable
mathematician who ,
it is quite possible, might detect some
germs of valuable ideas amid much inaccuracy and miscon
struction . Very important is his statement that we must
assume a physical unit which is not to be appreciated by
sense any more than is a true sphere . He holds that
mathematical science starts from multiple un its according
to the kind of mathematical consideration involved— a
doctrine which he tried to develop later .
The Emperor rewarded him with less than ,
in all prob
ability, he expected ; a treatise on alchemy or astrology
would have procured him a far richer reward .
“
I stayed
six months at Prague,
and whilst I maintained myself there
I got a book on Geometry printed, which I presented to the
Emperor, who gave me three hundred dollars ; and, pos
sessed of these,
I left Prague .

In 1 576, Helmstedt in the duchy ofBrunswick suddenly

found itself in a position which it failed to keep very
many years . In that year a university was opened there
which became one of the chief seats of learning in Ger
many .
1
I ts founder, Duke Julius of that ancient house of
Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel
, which traced descent from Ason ,
marquis of Este, was a somewhat effusive,
stimulating
potentate who took the fancy of his people . His policy
was conservative and directed by dynastic and personal
motives, although his motto declared :
“ I spend myself in
succouring others . A Protestant , he allowed his son and
successor, Henry Julius,
to become the nominally Catholic
Bishop of Halberstadt at the age of fourteen ; but it is
to his credit that when he abolished monastic houses he
abstained from enriching himself thereby .
2 The articles
of this new university aimed at controlling angry con
trov ersi ali s ts . The establishment was adorned by fifty
professors . Whether the constitution of the Academy
attracted B runo we do not know . All that he tells us
is :
“ P rovidence, not Chance,
conducted me to this place .
” 3
He matriculated Jan . 1 3th ,
1 5 89 . Julius died shortly after
his arrival , and Bruno was so far successful that some time
after the funeral he was allowed to deliver and print a
funeral oration . In it, he spoke of being an exile for
truth
’
s sake ; he
“ had suffered from the hungry tooth
of the Roman wolf, but is now in the enjoyment of complete
freedom .
” 4 Bruno did not stop with the word wolf
uncalculating , unguarded, headlong as ever, he

casts the

of the mind in mathematics and those subtle sympathies
in Nature concerning which the age was ready to believe
almost anything . Magic meant to Bruno natural opera
tions which are obscure and surprising but of which ,
eventually, We may hOpe to learn the real character and
laws . His mnemonic system was regarded as a species of
occult science, for, quite apart from the Black Art, magical
sciences were recognised as properly occupied with mathe
ma ti cs , physical sympathies, obscure causes and effects ,
such divine subjects as inspiration and prophecy,
judicial
astrology, metaphysical speculation etc .
, Bruno had already
exhibited interest in what the Church held to be a dangerous
borderland between the lawful and unlawful : in England he
had written concerning the extraordinary effects wrought
by the On e Spirit in all things .
1 He dedicated his De
M agi a to a pupil named Besler, a youth from Nurn berg,
whose father had studied under Luther and whose brother
gained distinction a s a botanist . Besler continued to act
as Bruno
’
s copyist, and either accompanied or followed him
to Padua .
2
In 1 866 the manuscripts of nine treatises and a
larger work of Bruno
’
s were put on the market at Paris
and are now in the Moscow Library . These, known as
the Noroff MS S .
, are for the most part in Bes ler
’
s hand ;
but a little was written by Bruno himself. A copy of the De
M agi a is at Moscow, dated 1 590, and a later MS . by the
same copyist is preserved in the Augustan Library at
Erlangen ,
together with the two codices of

hitherto unpublished writings are now available in the
State Edition .
De M agi a Concerning Magic treats of mathematics
as hidden or occult operations to be found both in Mind
and in Nature . Action and reaction at a distance are
accounted for on Neo-Platonic principles of universal ani
mism and mutual influences . Many marvels of a mi racu
lous nature are accepted as due to natural operations ,
the
precise nature of which remains undiscovered .
1 Everything
may be reduced to the antagonistic yet co-operative prin
ciples of love and hate, or attraction and repulsion . There
is one Soul of the World, of which finite . souls are passing
phases , and all things are derived from the Divine, but exist
in successively decreasing degrees of reality and truth .
There are also MS . excerpts from Agrippa and o ther
authors with annOtations by Bruno : all belong to this
period .

AT FRANKFURT AND ZU RI CH
THE Free City of Fran kfurt-on-the-Main was one of the
most important places in Germany . The Golden Bull of
1 356 constituted it the seat of Imperial Election . It was a
renowned centre of trade, and twice a year, at Eastertide
and at Michaelmas, merchants from every country were to
be found at its famous fair . It stood first in the bookselling
and printing trade of Germany. A member of the Protestant
party,
its city-fathers found it commercially advantageous to
tolerate Roman Catholics and all the factions of the revolt
against Rome, even the Socinian faction . An evil reputa
tion indeed must have preceded Bruno, for we find it
recorded in the Book of the Burgomaster, July 2 nd,
that when he begged permission to dwell in the house of
Wechel
,
the printer,
it was Resolved that his petition be
refused and that he be told to take his penny elsewhere.
”
Printers were erudite men in those days, and scholars
and statesmen foregathered at their shops, which were true
intellectual centres where the latest books were seen a nd
discussed, Where news a nd ideas came in from abroad and
dilettante courtiers could meet and gossip . The printers
were in the habit, not only of lodging travelling scholars
while they were printing their books, but of taking travelling
nobles as boarders ;
for the great scholars usually preferred
seclusion to the honour and profit of receiving guests who
were likely to disturb their studies and households, even if
1 No. 160, p. 48 .
2 2 0
AT FRANKFU RT AND ZURICH 2 2 1
they should be well-paid for the service .
1 Sidney had been
the guest of the Wechels, and it is possible that Bruno was
enabled to get a footing with them by reason of the two
books he had dedicated to one whose chivalrous behaviour
on the field of Warn sfeld,
followed by his death, not only
made him the idol of his countrymen but added additional
glory
'
to a name whi ch
‘ was already famous throughout
Europe . John Wechel contrived ,
in spite of
t
he prohibi
tion ,
to get Bruno received at the Carmelite monastery, and
provided him with means of support
"
.
2 Jhc
’
obii
'
s Bri ctanus,
3
a middle-aged man who was born at Antwerp , but who had
settled as a bookseller at Venice ,
told the Inquisitors that
he had met and talked with Bruno at Frankfurt and at
divers other places . Bruno had never spoken to him about
Christianity or Catholicism, but the Prior of this Carmelite
monastery told him t hat
“ he was chiefly occupied in writ
ing and in the vain and chimerical imagining of novelties .
Heretic doctors read with him ;
for in that city they are
mostly heretical .
” The innovator and
“ awakener
”
could
not fail to produce misgivings and discomfort among the
good fathers, and one is not surprised to learn that when
Brictanus asked the Prior what manner of man Bruno
might be, he was told that he was a man of fine intellect
and erudition— a universal man— but he
”
(
the Prior)
“ did
not believe him to possess a trace of religion ; adding that
he professed to know more than did the Apostles and could ,
if he wished, make the whole world of one religion.
” 4 Asked
who were his intimate friends, Bri ctanus could not mention
any . S O Bruno would seem to have experienced that
mental isolation which is the usual lot of the original
, or

even of the merely independent,
thinker ! Giambattista
Ciotto, a young Sienese of 2 7, who kept a bookshop i n the
Merceria,
the chief street of Venice, under the S ign of
Minerva , and through whose agency much evil was to
follow, saw a good deal of Bruno during the fairs . But he ,
too,
though later on Bruno frequented his shop in Venice,
never heard him say anything which could arouse suspicion
as to his not being a good Catholic .
1
At the Fairs, Bruno would find himself face to face with
all sorts and conditions of men , and in intellectual touch with
all that was most vigorous in European thought and life .
The first work of Bruno
’
s printed by Wechel and Fischer,
De tr ip/i ci M i n imo et M ensura , was dedicated to Duke
Henry Julius of Brunswick . The dedication was not by
the author but by the printers . It is dated Feb . 1 3
th,
1 59 1 ,
and states that Bruno was
“ forced by an unexpected event
to leave the city when only the last leaf remained for him
to finish, and, being unable to correct this as he had done to
the rest of the work, he wrote asking us to complete in his
name the labour forbidden to him by fate .
” We are in
darkness as to what had happened . It may have been that
the City Fathers were about to follow up their resolution by
ejection ;
2 or it may have been that an invitation from the
lord of Elgg necessitated a hurried (and, perhaps, prudent
)
departure . John Henry Hainz ell, of a literate Augsburg
family, had just acquired the estate of Elgg, near Z urich .
Hainz ell studied alchemy, was greatly inclined to the un
canny and mysterious, and exercised a noble hospitality to
thinkers and especi ally to those who claimed acquaintance
with the border-land of exact knowledge .

might have prejudiced his case with the judges .
1 “ Some
times Prudence hides the truth with her skirts in order to
escape blame and outrage .
” 2
There is no record of permission having been given for
the publication of De M ona a
’
e, with its far more important
and larger adjunct , De I mmenso, or of De Composz
'
ti one,
but both volumes bear the date 1 59 1 , and we learn from
Ba s s éi us
’ Catalogue of Frankfurt books that they were
ready for the Michaelmas Fair. The first of these volumes
was dedicated,
like the De Tr z
'
pli cz
' M i n imo,
“ to the very
illustrious and reverend prince Henry Julius,
duke of
Brunswick and Luneberg, bishop of Halberstadt
,
”
and all
were printed by the partners John Wechel and Peter
Fischer.
In the Golden Book of Venice, wherein the families of
the oligarchy were inscribed,
stood the noble house of
Mocenighi , so distinguished that it gave three doges to
the State in the 1 5
th century and one in the 16th .
“ One
day, deposed Giambattista Ciotto,
the bookseller, Signor
Giovanni Mocenigo, a patrician of Venice, when he was
buying a recent work of Giordano
’
s,
3 asked me if I knew
him, and if I knew where he was staying . I told him
that I had seen him at Frankfurt and believed he was still
there; whereupon the said Sig . Mocenigo added ,
‘
I should
like him to come to Venice to teach me the secrets of
memory and the other things which he professes , as one may
see in this book .
’ To this I answered,
‘
It is believable
that,
if besought
, he will come .
’ Some days afterwards,
Sig. Mocemgo brought me a letter addressed to the said

Giordano, beseeching me to deliver it and saying that
he wrote to ask him if he would come to Venice .
” 1
Bruno
’
s account runs :
“ Being in Frankfurt last year,
I received two letters from Sig . Giovanni Mocenigo,
inviting
me to Venice to teach him the art of memory and discovery,
with promises to treat me well
, and that I should be satis
fi ed with him .
” 2
Now Bruno had not always misjudged concerning what
might befall him . In England he wrote of the procession
of 50 or 100 torches in broad mid-day that would not be
lacking in a Roman Catholic country .
” 3 But he had
dwelt in Roman Catholic countries and been less subject
to the molestation and oppression which he experienced at
Geneva, Marburg and Helmstedt . Venice like Frankfurt
was a centre of trade, and the love of lucre so prevailed
over the love of God that heretics found a fairly safe
asylum there . She was a city renowned for her intellectual
and artistic force and the beautiful productions of her
printers,
to whom much liberty was allowed . Many of
the books published in Venice were condemned by Rome,
though,
indeed,
this was largely due to the efforts of a
rival press to secure monopoly. Venice alone amon g
Italian States had preserved her independence of foreign
Catholic Powers ;
she alone had resisted resolutely and ,
in the main,
successfully the encroachments of the Papacy
on civil liberty . Lulli sm was at the time a fashionable
craz e among the rich young dilettanti of Venice fso there
was prospect of lucrative occupation .
4 Bruno had received
a renewed invitation from a member of a renowned and
powerful house, and was offered protection . He may
have known that Giovanni Mocenigo,
a man now entering
on middle life (he was 34 had been one of the Assessors

of the State to t he Inquisiti on ;
Ifso,
surely an invitation
from such a source ensured safety . Bruno never regarded
himself as other than a Roman Catholic . So secure did he
feel that even when he found himself trapped he felt no

”
He entertai ned the extraordinary delusion that he could
induce the Church to receive him again and allow himto
dwell unmolested and outside his order in his own beloved
province .
1 Not all his bitter experience had taught him
the invincible,
terrific power which is achieved over the minds
and actions of most men by doctrines early instilled and forti
fi ed by habit
,
tradition , general consent and authoritative
pressure ; how feeble is the mere intellect to overthrow
passionate bigotry or push aside passionate ignorance or
calm the resentment of menaced power .
He had written of himself as citiz en and servant of the
world ,
child of the sun and mother earth he was, he
said , no mere stranger and out of place in foreign lands,
but
, as a member of the Divine Universe,
could share its
life in any place . He said this with his head ; his heart
throbbed for home . Venice might prove a stepping stone
towards his never forgotten and dearly loved Campagna .
Once in Venice, might he not, by discreet conduct and
working through men of i nfluence, return to his native
soil ! In a fatal moment he resolved to trust to the
honour of a Venetian patrician and to the historic inde
pend en c e of the Venetian State .

first books contain a restatement of the teachings of the
Ca usa ,
somewhat improved and more detailed . The remain
ing three are chiefly mathematical . The main argument is
concerned with the threefold unity of three speculative
sciences , which are of God, who is
“ both the greatest and
the least that may be of the unitary individual soul
, and
of the material atom or physical unit .
1 As successive works
of Bruno appear one finds in them a gradual disappearance
of mere Neo-Platonism and theory of emanation ,
less mere
admiration of the transcendency of God and deeper con
templation of His immanence in Nature .
2 These Latin
poems are chiefly concerned with the Operations of a Living
Universe .
Five years before Descartes was born, we find declared
here that
“ whoso i tcheth to Philosophy must set to work
by putting all things to the doubt .
” 3
The thinker seeks the Universal ; he would have know
ledge ofsome underlying principle, some supporting sub
stance underlying the flux of things . Such a substance
must be simple,
that is to say, without parts,
for if it had
parts these would again require a single, simple principle
or substrate . Thought necessitates the unchanging amid
change, ever at one with itself. Differences of number,
the
Opposition of good and evil, all contraries,
in a word, must
be at one, as Cusanus taught . The greatest must be at one
with the least ;
the maximum coincide with the minimum . So
is it with God . He is
“ a unit,
the source of all numbers,
Wholly simple,
the substance of magnitude and composition ,
a dignity above every phase, not to be computed,
infinitely
great .
” 4 “ He is the unit of units .

regard the Absolute One as bare unity. In a work written
just before this one was published our a uthor writes : In
themselves things change, and,
in the material world, are
effects and imperfect . They are rather not-beings than
beings,
for they iss ue from the void and, so far from truly
being,
they depart into the void . Their true existence must
be where they cannot but be,
in that first cause and perfect
principle wherein lies the will and the power for their pro
duction at pleasure . Wherefore their true being is in the
Monad itself, wherei n, consequently,
they are truly known ,
in simplicity and concurrence ;
for there all things are one,
Without distinction or dispersion or number ; but this in an
i nefi
'
a ble way .
” 1
Bruno regards the unit from metaphysical, physical and
critical points of view .
2 Metaphysically considered ,
the
soul is an eternal minimum,
the possibility of change . He
was resolved to treat fully of metaphysics and of the soul
“ if it should please God to bestow on him time .
” To our
loss ,
it was not permitted . There are minima of spirit
,
which are not further reducible and wherein absolute spiri t
manifests itself. The relation of these minima to absolute
spirit is not shown , nor could it be,
since one term of the
relation at least remains quite ineffable . Bruno would seem
in another work to incline to the opinion that they cannot
be regarded as mere parts or divisions of the one spirit
, but
truly it remains in doubt .
” 3
No less than minima of spirit, souls or centres of ex
peri ence, must we posit minima in the physical world .
Bruno definitely adopts an atomic theory . The material

universe, he says,
is composed of irreducible units or atoms ,
which enter into composition as do the letters of the alphabet
into the formation of words .
1
I t must be so, since there
cannot be infinite divisibility ;
for could we go on subdividing
for ever there would be no substance : there must be some
minimum which has no parts . And if it were not so,
every
thing would be penetrable : there would be no resistance
of body to body . Composition c hanges, but the absolute
minimum or substance is immortal : it is the possibility
of change . Physical differences depend on this possibility
being realiz ed in the composition of these simple, homo
gen eous atoms . Each minimum is the centre of an energy
which is an external quality and which is endlessly ex
tended . It is indestructible, endlessly in motion , and this
activity it derives from the Operation offinal causes which
issue from the individual soul or from the Soul of the World .
Each mi mmum or least thing is also the possibility of its
own maximum, drawing all the other minima it may into
connexion with itself.
2 And most of all must this be said
of the Unit of Units, wherein the maximum and minimum
and all qualities coincide and are at one .
3 Bruno
’
s Absolute
is self-conscious Spirit
,
containing and knowing all that is
within itself.

An atom is spherical .
5 Atoms come into contact at points
on their s uperfi ci es ,
leaving curved triangular spaces be
tween them .
6 Since they touch with a limited surface
only, we must be careful to distinguish between body and
li mi t, and not to confuse these as Aristotle does .

In other
words, we must not confound mathematical intuitions with

physical atom,
is immortal .
1 From this and one or two
similar remarks elsewhere, some writers have supposed
that Bruno came at last to throw over the teaching of the
Ca usa and to believe in personal immortality. Here, he
speaks of the transformations of the soul as not following
one another in haphaz ard fashion, but as depending on the
kind of life which has been led . Taken a a pi ea
’
de la Zettre,
this is an ex plicit assertion of personal immortality . But
one often has to read the real Bruno between the written
lines , and, above all
,
to compare every one of his utterances
on a subject before one can form a conclusive judgment as
to his real meaning . He repeats in this work that there is
one Soul of the World, manifesting itself in manifold forms,
and the passage may be merely his way of expressing the
secret sympathies
”
of nature which produce such facts as
heredity,
the transmission of ideas through space and time ,
definite tendencies in matter and mind etc . etc . Professor
Mc In ty re thinks Bruno came to accept personal immor
tality .
2 Tocco,
the completest and minutest of Brunian
scholars , once thought so too,
3 but,
since he had access to
the manuscript works which have now been published,
partly under his care, he has completely changed his Opinion .
He maintains that,
in Bruno
’
s philosophy, while Matter is
resolved into insensible,
irreducible atoms, Spirit is not thus
fractioniz ed,
but remains always one with itself in quality
and substance .
4
It may be questioned whether Bruno ever
regarded the atomic theory as other than a relative one for
human knowledge . But Tocco charges him with i ncon
sistency and dualism in applying one pr1nc1pl e to brute

matter and another principle to mind . In the La mpas ,
written at Wittenberg,
in the Spa cci o and elsewhere, Bruno
writes that neither body nor soul need fear death,
since
both are eternal and constant pr1nc1ples . But the reduction
of the Universe to two distinct principles— matter and spirit,
if in s ome measure anticipatory of Descartes ,
is not made
absolute. There remains the all-inclusive, all-comprehen
sive Unity which is at once Divine Intuition and Divine
Power and all things else . No category is really ultimate for
the Nolan . Ifhe divides matter and spirit, he does not finally
divorce them . And he were a bold thinker to day who
should be so assured of the certainties of science and of his
own metaphysical power as to interpret electrons in terms
of spirit or spirit in terms of electrons . Bruno
’
s atoms
would seem to be v i rtually active spirit under the direction
of individual souls . Thus, animal centres of experience
direct the atomic evolution of the body from the heart as
a centre .
1
With regard to Bruno
’
s assertions , often so obscure,
concerning immortality, we must remember that it was his
wont, as indeed was necessary, even for an unguarded
person ,
to speak in guarded language . He employs
current conceptions to rise above them ; he makes use of
any aspect of the Pythagorean or a n y other philosophy
which approximates towards his own and which will give
his own view some measure ofauthoritative support ; he is
fond of suggestive mythology, and lures the learner onward
with
“ language of accommodation for is there not in all
things some trace of truth, more or less clearly discernible
The reflective student can usually penetrate through the
mask, which is at once an incitement and a clue . Just here
there are considerable difficulties in the way of interpreta
tion . We have seen that
,
in the Wittenberg
“ Lamp ,

wrote of how some think particular beings to be particular
manifestations of the S Oul oft he World ; others,
that the
Soul of the World is divided into parts truly it remai ns i n
doubt, but we incline to the first Opinion .
” 1 A little further
on he writes that multiplication falls on the S ld e of brute
matter,
the soul remaining one .
2 Ofan underlying iden ti
fi cation of the individual centre of experience with the
Universal Experience, Bruno felt sure . And that implies
a higher, fuller immortality than mere personal continuance
with memory-synthesis, or mere continued being-i n -flux
without memory . Yet neither of these is inconsistent with
Bruno
’
s central conception . Probably he formed no definite
conclusion about matters which he would regard as of minor
importance and unsupported by conclusive evidence . Tocco
writes :
“ The individualisation of the soul is for Bruno a
fleeting event which in the infinite bosom of time has but
the stability and duration of a flash .
” 3 But assuredly
Bruno meant much more than this . As has been shown ,
he identifies the human spirit with the Absolute Spirit in
the last resort, and of the Absolute Spirit he writes in a
work of approximately the same date that
“ past is not
present t o it as past, or future as future, but the whole of
time is present to it wholly, at once and complete .
” 4 To
die,
” he says elsewhere,
is to s pr1ng i nto life .
” And in
the great poem published at the autumn fair, after such
pieces of Pythagorean metaphor as ,
“ the organs of a
horse may await those of a man and all other creatures
in regular or irregular progression
”
he immediately adds ,
“ present organic death has nothing to do with the count
less forms of enduring life . Were the Spirit but aware of

distinction between limit or boundary and the physical
body which it bounds . For example , he treats of the line
as a file of atoms .
1 He tried to simplify geometry by
making the greater part of i t intuitively comprehensible
through three vastly involved figures .
II . THE U NIT
At the autumn fair, Wechel and Fischer produced the
remainder of the great poem, permission for the printing of
which is not recorded in the Frankfurt Censorial Register .
I t was entitled
“ Of the Unit, Quantity and Shape, A
Book Following The Five On The Least, The Great And
Measure . Also Eight Books Concerning The Innumerable,
Immeasurable An d In figura bl e, Or OfThe Universe An d
Its Worlds
2
In fact,
two volumes were bound up in one .
The first of these , Ofthe Unit ,
”
commences with laudatory
verses addressed to Duke Henr Brunswick .
Bruno contrasts the strenuous life 0 love truth
with that led by pleasure-seekers and the idle rich . It is
clear that the long struggle with Obscurantists ,
the buffets
of exile, persecution by academies, and the general ill
success which attended his mission had left their marks .
The iron had entered into his soul . Yet he is still un
daunted ,
and sings with prophetic instinct :
“ Whatever
cruel fate shall await me,
the struggle began far back in
boyhood, and, God be witness,
I follow the truth unv an
qui shed, nor may death itself bear the smallest terror to
me , nor in any wise do I blench before the violence of any
mortal man .
” 3 And later in the book, he sings :
“ I have

fought : it is much . Victory lies i n the hands of Fate .
Be that with me as it may, whoev er
’
shall prove conqueror,
future ages will not deny that I did not fear to die, was
second to none in constancy, and preferred a spirited death
to a craven life .
” 1 Here, says Brunnhofer,
is Bruno
'
s
epitaph .
There are many fine poetic passages,
too often marred by
ugly neologisms, curi ous syntax and execrable prosody.
Apart from these,
the sole interest of the book to the
modern reader lies in the singularity Of that pronounced
occultism which held so much attraction for men of the
Renaissance . The scientific e ducation of the day was not
built on the secure foundation of careful observation and ex
perimen t . Stress was laid on word and symbol
, with CUI
‘
IOUS
results . With greater sagacity, men put faith in intuitions
springing from the mind,
like Minerva from the brain of
her Divine Father ; but they knew little of the methods of
verification . Bruno draws largely from many sources in this
work , but chiefly from Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa ofNettes
heim .
2 He tells us that the work deals with revelation ,
faith
and divination , and not with reasoned knowledge and ex peri
ment . He takes occasion to protest against dogmas which
disturb human calm and the peace of ages, put out the light
of the mind and avail not in morals .
”
The work is, however, chiefly filled with a selection of
such mystical and philosophic lore as fell in with the
author
’
s own conceptions and with a singular series of
geometrical constructions founded upon a theory of distinct
mathematical minima, and upon the numerical mysteries of
Pythagoras , all invested with metaphysical significance .
One is the perfect number,
the source of infinite series .

Even so does an infinity of worlds proceed from one sub
stance ;
the diversity of the universe and all its creatures
being due to the union of the On e and the Many .
III . ON IMMENS ITY
The De I mmenso is a very great book indeed. It is a
prolonged hymn of wonder and praise and intellectual
exaltation , sung in the temple of immensity . Perhaps it
may be ranked with the Causa as the greatest of Bruno
’
s
works . Essentially in line
'
with the ex plict idealists of the
early nineteenth century, he always tries to unite his
idealism with scientific conceptions of the Universe .
1 The
spirit of kinship with which he regards the starry host
is that of a poet lately among us :
S o may we read and little find them cold
Not frosty lamps,
illumining d ead space,
Not distant ali ens, not senseless Powers .
The fire i s in them whereof we are born,
The music of their motion may be ours .
De Immenso is a restatement of the cosmic teaching of
the great Italian works, often more detailed and more
precise . Like the De M i n imo and De M ona de it consists
of Latin verses and prose annotations thereon . Seven
years had passed since the first bold attempts to furnish
the world with a new cosmology . As presenting Bruno
’
s
views in their final form,
the work is of the highest import
ance ;
but,
since these have been dealt with in the order
in which they were given to the public ,
it is not necessary
to do more than present a general notion of the work and
set down 1ndi cation s of advance .
He says there is an incessant unfolding of Nature in move

2 40 GIORDANO BRUNO
the scintillation of sun and stars is due to rapidity of rota
tion but the phenomenon is not observable in planets
,
which do not give out light, but only reflect i t .
1
He exhibits great interest in comets and shows that he
was closely following the observations of the astronomers of
his time ; he casts aside the notion , which had prevailed
since the time of Aristotle,
that they were slowly burning
vapours, set afi re by the motion of the stars ,
and he
recognises that these wandering Arabs of the sky a re
genuine members of the cosmic system and subject to
cosmic law . Meteors are also cosmic matter, wandering
through space ;
they are living beings .
2 He had but a
poor notion of the relative distances of the planets : he di d
not think Jupiter or Saturn could be much farther from the
sun than the Earth is , or that their period of revolution
could be much longer than our year .
3
Seven years before, he would seem to have believed the
stars and planets to be eternal,
though subject to v i ci s si
tude
4 but now he says that only the Universe as a whole
is eternal
;
its worlds decay and perish,
their constituent
parts enterin g into fresh combinations .
5
He attacks the superstitions interwoven with all religions ,
and especially the creed of those Catholics who put the
Pope in the place of God .
6 He is still as filled with religious
enth usiasm and poetic fire as when his eyes were first
Opened to transcendent truth ; he rejoices now as then in
the confident vision of an everliving,
infinite universe and
its innumerable choirs of flaming sp1ri ts dwelling under the
reign of ever-unfolding,
spiritual law .
It is worthy of note that he refers sympathetically and
almost proudly to the daring sea-dogs of Britain who had

IV. ON IMAGES , SIGNS AND IDEAS
At the same autumn fair appeared the last work given to
the world by Bruno himself. There is no record extant of
permission for its publication but it is mentioned , with the
date of its appearance ,
in Ba s s aus
’ Frankfurt Catalogue of
1 59 2 .
“ The Arrangement OfImages, Signs And Ideas
” 2
is preceded by a dedicatory letter to Heinrich Hainz ell
,
the
“ distinguished and most generous
”
lord of Elgg . Bruno
informs Hainz ell that this is one of his most important
works , having for its object the description of how images ,
signs and ideas may be so ordered in the mind as to sub
serve a general scheme for the discovery and arrangemen t
of truths and for the fixing of them in the memory. The
greater part of the treatise is in prose, but there are excur
sions into verse . There are three books,
the first consisting
of two sections . The author extracts all that he considers
of first importance from the De Umbris, Ca ntns Ci red zi s
and S zlgillus, condensing and improving without greatly
altering . The work is indeed an important one, for,
although Neo-Platonic distinctions are adopted, Neo-Platonic
doctrine is widely departed from, and a position is taken up
which is,
in essence,
that of the great German Idealists .
“ The simplest operations of arithmetic are very easy,
”
he
says, y et
“ to do these is to do everything to say them is
to say everything . Herein the whole light is more

present, clear and obvious to our intelligence than is the
outer light of the sun to the eyes . Sha
’
ll I call it a
power, however, because so few know and understand
Because the eye beholdeth other things ,
itself it doth not
see . But what is that eye which beholdeth other things in
such wise that it may perceive itself! It is that eye which
seeth all things in itself, and which even is all things .
” 1
At the commen cemen t
l
of the book we come across a
passage where, couched in scholastic terminology,
is the
identification of thought and thing,
intellect and substance,
memory and nature, knowledge and fact .
“ Ideas are the
cause of things prior to the things ,
the vestiges of ideas are
the things themselves,
that is to say,
they exist in things ;
the shadows of ideas are derived from things,
that is to say,
they are subsequent on them .
”
He again records his belief in mystic intuition , writing of
the interior intuition which is both the light and that which
it illumines, differing from external intuition as a mirror
which only reflects would from a mirror illuminated of its
own nature wherein object and sensitive subject
are one .
” 3
That same Pythagorean fallacy is repeated which runs
through all Bruno
’
s work and all the philosophy of his
time, v iz . ,
that,
S ince simple numbers can be clearly con
cei v ed and are without contradiction,
they represent the
ultimate constitution of the Universe and possess objective
ex istence .
He perceived the unity of the fine arts and that know
ledge is a constructive art ; and one may infer from the
following passage that he found keener enjoyment in sight
than in hearing :
“ There be men who find harmony through
the eye ;
other s,
though in less measure,
through the ear .

itself,
is nevertheless a means to good . We can observe
Will operant in Nature (voluntas uaturali a)
as a self
moving principle, intelligent and prescient . God is not
merely transcendent ; but,
in fact, operates through Nature
and is in Nature . Wherefore thorough investigation of
Nature can neve r give what is base or false . Philosophic
truth is certitude, procurable by setting forth from the
gates of sense . It cannot be at variance with theologic
truth , as the upholders of the Twofold truth maintained ,
although the latter is given by revelation from a superior
intelligence ( S umma sub evideutz
'
a )

VI . THE FAS TENI NGS OF KIND
During his second and longer stay at Frankfurt
, Bruno
wrote with his own hand
“ The Fastenings Of Kind,
” 1
which he never finished . A part of this was copied by
Besler , pretty certainly at Padua , and detail was added .
Both MS S . , which were discovered in Paris during the
last century, are now preserved at Moscow with the other
NoroffManuscripts .
This treatise is on Moral Science from an objective point
of view,
the passions being dealt with in the cold, detached
manner of an impartial observer . The different kinds of
love which bind the human spirit are discussed, and sexual
attraction is discussed in a singularly straightforward ,
naturalistic way, unrelieved by the smallest dash of senti
ment . Here and there, passages from the Italian works
are repeated . As in De M agz
'
a , an attempt is made to
reduce the attractions and repulsions to be found in Nature
no less than in human feelings and emotions to the con
trary
and opposite principles of Love and Hate . As
with Dante, Hate is regarded as Love inverted . After

human mind, acting through the imagination .

THERE had been a time when the human spirit, braced by
the discovery of ancient letters and of a new world, enjoyed no
small measure of freedom under Popes who we
‘
re themselves
distinguished sons of the Renaissance ; but such liberty was
neverformally authori s ed and established, and theshock which
Protestant aggression gave to the Catholic conscience and
the dwindling power and purse of the Roman theocracy had
by this time caused a complete reversal of Papal policy .
Bruno,
in spite of the persecution he had endured at the
hands of minor officials, believed in the sweet reasonable
ness of a Church which tacked and temporised so often
in the past, and which was even now governed by so many
wise statesmen, had the adherence of so many scholars and
numbered so many sincere priests . Filled with his own
sincerity and a belief in the triumph of truth,
the lessons
of his life in Naples, Geneva, Paris and Germany were
lost on him . Candid and of generous and Open mind, he
judged the rulers of the Church by his own high liberal
standard and that of a few like-minded friends . He had
not the least doubt as to the genuine Catholicity of his
own belief, and that he only needed access to high autho
rity to be
"
restored to the bosom of his Church . Mocenigo
sent him more than one pressing invitation
1 and probably
promised him ample protection .

and troops of Protestants might be observed, making their
way to the University or to a tutor
’
s rooms ; and these
“ not of suche students alone as most commonli e are
brought up in our un iv ersi tees (meane mens children sent
to s chole in hope to live upon hyred learning)
but for the
more parte of noble mens sonnes , and of the best gentil
men : that studie
'
more for knowledge and pleasure than
for curios i tee or luker .
” 1 The presence of wealthy students
was advantageous to the private lecturer ; moreover, a
student was
“ bound to no lectures, nor nothing else but
what he ly s t himself to go to .
” 2 But many of them
“ ly s ted
”
to rioting and feates of arms .
”
Bruno had Besler for company,
— Besler acted as his copyist,
— and he met men whom he had known in Germany ;
con
ceiv ably, men, also, whom he had known in England .
Strange that he did not take alarm at what was being
said about his presence in Italy ! The scholars in Frank
furt marvelled at his temerity.
3 What the Germans in Italy
thought
, we may read in a passage of a letter written by
Hav ekenthal of Brandenburg (Valens Acidalius
), who was
studying at Bologna,
to Michael Forgacz of Bavaria, who
was at Padua . Tell me, he asks in a letter dated January
2 1 s t,

“ tell me of
‘ yet
another matter. It is said that
Giordano Bruno the Nolan whom you knew at Wittenberg
is living among you at Padua . Can this be so ! What
manner of man is this, an ex ile, as he was used to admit,
to
dare to re-enter Italy ! I marvel

Bruno would seem to have felt no fear . He
\ had been
dwelling in freer lands than Italy and did not realise the
changes effected by the enforcement of the decrees of
Trent. Nay, he went on with studies which the Church
regarded as at least questionable . He was employing
Besler in copying De Vi nculi s and ancient, unprinted
works ; among them being the
“ Seals of Hermes and
Ptolemy,
”
a work whidh was found in his possession at
Venl ce and which he was careful to state had been praised
by Albertus Magnus,
2
the
“ Universal Doctor
”
of the
Church . He confesses that he had not seen too closely
into the contents of these books ;
indeed this particular one
he had not read . He was philandering with perilous material
,
preparatory to a study ofjudicial astrology.
3
Whether or no Mocenigo
’
s taste for secret knowledge
included hankerings after the Black Art
”
is not apparent .
He was eager to get Bruno into his house at Venice, and
offered tempting terms .
“ He would support me well and
I should be satisfied with him,
”
says Bruno . In a fatal
hour the unsuspecting thinker put his head into a noose .
He accepted the offer of a treacherous and incapable dabbler,
returned to Venice in March,
1 59 2, and took up his abode
with Mocenigo in the little Campo of S . Samuele, on the Grand
Canal
,
just opposite the palace where our Browning died .

At first,
it would seem that all went well . He frequented
booksellers
’
s hops and chatted with the learned people whom
he met there . Ciotto would seem to have heard no heretical
talk, and Bricta nus said that Giovanni had not spoken to
him on such matters .
” 1 The fame of his abilities spread in
Venice . There were literary clubs of a social character
there as elsewhere in Italy, and the most distinguished
circle was wont to assemble at the hospitable house of
Andrea Morosini
,
the historian , a man now “ in the middle
of the journey of our life —he was 35 . Here were to be
met all the cultivated patricians, Fra Paoli Sarpi
,
the famous
printers and every Venetian of note who was interested in
things of the mind . Morosini was a broad-minded Catholic,
and ,
from the leanings of some of his guests, may have
given his evidence with due caution and reservation . Any
how, he related a t the trial that
“ For some months past
certain philosophical books had been on sale at Venetian
booksellers, bearing the name of Giordano Bruno, a man
reputed to be of varied learning . I unders tood from what
I heard in Venice and from what Gio . Battista (Ciotto)
the
bookseller said to diverse gentlemen, and especially to my
self,
that this man was here and that we might desire to get
him to our house, where certain gentlemen and also prelates
are wont to come for the discussion of literature and above
all of philosophy . Wherefore I said that he should get him
to come ;
and he did so several times , debating,
on various
learned matters . I have never been able to infer from his
reasonings that he held any opinion contrary to the faith,
and,
so far as I am concerned, I have always considered
him to be a Catholic— and at the least suspicion of the
contrary I should not have allowed his presence in my
house .
” 2
“ Many patricians and literary people gathered together

especially one on the seven liberal arts ,
1
together with other
of my printed works, both those which I confirm and those
which I do not confirm, and place myself at the feet of His
Beatitude (for I have heard that he loves upright men),
and
to explain my case and to try to be absolved for my mis
behaviour and allowed to wear the clerical habit
, but free
from monastic authority, whereunto I have spoken during
these last days to many Neapolitan Fathers of my order who
were here
”
(
rather a perilous proceeding, perhaps !)
“ and
particularly Father Superior Fra Domenico of Nocera ,
Father S erafi no of Nocera , Father Giovanni
, who comes I
know not whence, save that it is in the Kingdom of Naples ,
and yet another ofAtripalda , who left offhis habit but resumed
it I don
’
t know his name ;
in religion he was called Brother
Felice .
” 2 He repeated to his judges his desire to return to
the Church , but
'
to be relieved of the bonds of monastic
obedience .
3
In a singularly cramped handwriting there is confirmation
of Bruno
’
s statement. Father Domenico wri tes : I n this
very month of May, on the Holy Feast of Pentecost , as I was
coming out of the Sacristy of the Church of St . John and
St . Paul
, I observed a layman bow to me . At first I did
not know him ; but when he spoke to me saying,
‘ Come
into a private place,
’
I remembered him as one of our
brethren in the province of the kingdom, a man of letters ,
Brother Giordano of Nola by name . We withdrew to a
quiet place in the aforesaid church, and there he told me
the reason of his leaving our province and of the cause of
his unfrocking ; being excommunication by Fra Domenico
Vita, Provincial at the time . He told me of his sojournings
in many Kingdoms and at Royal Courts and of his important

work in lec turmg, but that he had always lived as a
Catholic . And when I asked him what he did in Venice
and how he subsisted, he said that he had been in Venice
but a very short time and had his own sufficient means ;
and that he wished to live quietly and set about the writ
ing of a book he had in mind,
l and
'
then ,
through important
patronage, he would present it to His Beati tudé and obtain
his pardon together with satisfaction of conscience for what
he had told me about . He hoped to stay in Rome,
to devote
himself to literature,
to show what he was made of and ,
perhaps,
to deliver some lectures .
” 1 During Lent he seems
to have gone frequently to the noble church of St . John and
St. Paul,
the Westminster Abbey of Venice, and also to the
s maller mediaeval church of S . Stefano which was close by
his quarters .
These efforts are quite interpretable . The original thinker
had found no country which
was not hostile to new ideas .
After his stormy experience he sought a haven in the Church
to which he had once given a love which he had never quite
lost, a church that had ennobled itself by periods of tolerance
and even by active help in the liberation of the human
spirit . Above all he desired to be able to return to his own
beloved district to my Province — without the odium of
apostacy but , at no price with the renewal of cloistered
life and discipline
! He says that he confided his desire to
Mocenigo as well as to Fra Domenico, and
“ he promised
to help me in all things which were right .
” Blind belief that
all men who might appear to be friendly towards him were
no less sincere and single minded than himself ! Filled with
his own ideas, he relaxed whatev er modicum of caution he
had exercised in Venice in the intimacy of guest and teacher
with host . Stroz z i gave the youthful traveller, Henry
Wotton , excellent advice when he told him to

in Italy. Bruno
said far too much to a man of just sufficient intelligence to
misunderstand and misrepresent ; one whose affectation
of a love of learning, friendliness and generosity disguised
a stupid, superstitious mind, a treacherous heart and a
mean,
sordid disposition . Such blindness is well-nigh in
conceivable .
Either, with depraved religious z eal
, perhaps a t the
instigation of the Inquisition , Mocenigo had set a trap for
Bruno and enticed him from Germany to hand him over to
the Holy Office when he had accumulated sufficient evi
dence ; or he was dissatisfied with the lessons he received .
He may have hankered after instruction in the Black Art
and taken a mean revenge when he found this not to be
forthcoming . Probably,
in any case Mocenigo
’
s confessor
had something to do with his action and took advantage of
the pupil
’
s discontent to egg him on and to direct his pro
c edure . The reader will be able to form his own surmise
from the facts to be produced . Mocenigo wrote to the In
qui s i tors
-

of my Confessor
2 and again : Since you have favoured
me with so much forbearance by pardoning my error in

Mocenigo, bent on betrayal
, went to Ciotto . Booksellers
had to be careful, for their avocation was a somewhat
dangerous one, although many works highly objectionable
to the Church were sold quite freely ;
the State being by
no means so subservient to ecclesiastical authority as to
interfere rashly with a trade which added to the riches and
reputation of the Commonwealth . Being learned men ,
they knew something of the contents of their wares . Ciotto
certainly, and Bri ctanus probably, had Bruno
’
s books on
their shelves . Before the Inquisition such witnesses might
well falter . Ifthey gave their evidence a colour favourable
to the prosecution they might have to excuse the fact of
selling heretical books ;
if they were taken to be favourable
to the accused they might find themselves in the same plight
with him . The impression one gets from the evidence of
Ciotto and Bri ctanus is that they stated what they knew
quite faithfully and simply. Ciotto said :
“ I was about to
start for the Frankfurt Fair last Easter when Signor G .
Mocenigo found me and asked me if I were going thither .
He said
‘ I have him (meaning Giordano)
here at my ex
pense . He has promised to teach me many things and has
had a quantity of clothes and money from me on this
account . I can bring him to no conclusion . I doubt
whether he is quite trustworthy. So,
since you are going
to Frankfurt, keep this in mind, and do me the service to
find out if anyone has faith in him and if he will carry out
his promises .
’ By reason of this, when I was in Frankfurt
I spoke with several scholars
‘
who had attended his lectures
when he was in that city and were acquainted with his
method and discourse . What they told me amounted to
this ,
that Giordano made strong professions of memory and
other similar secrets, but success with anyone was never
seen , and his pupils in this matter and others similar to it
were far fr om satisfied . They said more . They did not
AT VENICE AND PADUA 2 5 7
know how he could remain in Venice, for he is regarded as
a man without religion . This is all I gathered, and I told it
to Ser Giovanni when I returned from the fair, whereto he
replied,
‘
I also had my doubts of this ; but I wish to fi nd
out wha t I can draw from him ofthe i nstructi ons he has
p romi sed me, not to lose altogether wha t I ha ve gi ven h im,
a nd then I sha ll hand him over to the censure bfthe Holy
Ofi ce.
’ 1 Mocenigo also pumped the Flemish bookseller,
Brictanus , and declared that he ,
“ in particular,
spoke of
him to me, declaring him to be an enemy ofChristianity
and our faith, and that he had heard him utter great
heresy .
” 2 Brictanus, when examined, utterly refuted this
statement
!
According to his own showing ,
the pious patrician
’
s next
step was to consult his confessor, who advised him to
denounce Bruno to the Inquisition . Any feeble-minded,
muddle-headed intriguer could set its terrible,
remorseless
machinery in motion . Bruno seems to have become aware
that mischief was brewing . He tried to slip through the
net which was closing in . He considered that he had
discharged himself of even more than all the obligations
which he owed his host . He told his judges : I therefore
fesolv ed to return to Frankfurt and get certain of my
Works printed,
so last Thursday (
2 1 5 1: May)
I took leave
of him to go away, and,
according to what he said, he
believed I was not going to Frankfurt, but to teach what
I have taught him and others . He insisted on my remain
ing b ut I was equally set on going . He began to com
plain that I had
'
not taught him what I promised . Then
he used threats,
saying he would find means ,
if I did not
remain of my own free-will
,
to compel me . Next night
(Friday),
seeing that I was determi ned to go and that I
had settled up my affairs and a rranged for the transit
1 Doc. v.

.
R
2 5 8 GIORDANO BRUNO
of my belongings to Frankfurt, after I had gone to bed,
he came in , on the pretext of wishing to speak to me,
and was followed by his servant, Bartolo, and ,
if I mistake
not, five or six others, whom I believe to be gondoliers
of the neighbourhood . They made me get up and brought
me to a garret and locked me in : Ser Gion himself saying
that if I would remain and teach him the terms for the
memory of words and geometry as from the first he had
required, he would have me set free, but if not there would
be very unpleasant results . I replied that it always
seemed to me that I had taught him enough and more than
I engaged for, and that I was far from deserving such
treatment . He left me there until the following day,
when a captain entered with men whom I did not know,
and made them take me to a cellar in the basement where
they left me until night-time, when another captain came
with his squadron and brought me to the prisons of the
Holy Offi ce .
” 1 Later on , Bruno declared :
“ He not only
wished me to teach him all I know, but desi red to lea rn wha t
I am una ble to tea ch a ny body , and has constantly threatened
me in life and honour if I did not give him my knowledge .
” 2
Mocenigo impounded all Bruno
’
s money, clothes , manu
scripts and books and handed them over to the inquisition .
On e Matteo Av an ta,
captain under the Council of Ten ,
effected the arrest and removed him to the Prison of the
Inquisition , behind the walls of the Prison ,
to the west
of the Bridge of Sighs and facing the Ducal Palace . For
on that very day, May 2 3
rd, Mocenigo had denounced his
guest to His Very Reverend Paternity,
the Father Inquisitor
for Venice.
The small-brained man is usually crafty and malicious .
There is abundance of stupid misunderstanding, artful
perversion and odious fabrication in the three documents
1 Doc. vi
i
.
2 Doc. xi v.
2 60 GIORDANO BRUNO
all the doctors knew nothing, and that he could enlighten
the first theologians in the world so that they would be
unable to reply .
” Mocenigo then says that Bruno told him
the Inquisitors at Rome had prepared 1 30 charges, and that
he made offwhile they were being presented because he
was said to have thrown his accuser , or him whom he
believed to be such ,
into the Tiber .
1 He adds that Ciotto,
Bri ctan us and Morosini can confirm his statements . He
believes Bruno is possessed by a devil
, asks for a speedy
trial, and presents three printed works by the accused and
a manuscript On the Deduction of the Universal Predicates
of God
2 and certain hasty memoranda made by himself.
3
Searching questions would seem to have been put to the
Denouncer,
for another statement, dated the 2 sth May, runs
On the day when I held Bruno locked up,
I asked him if
he would fulfil his promises concerning what he proved
unwilling to teach me in return for my many acts of kind
ness and gifts,
so that I might not accuse him of so
many wicked words to me against our Lord Jesus Christ
and the Holy Catholic Church .
” Truly an astounding
piece of self-revelation ! The short-witted man discloses,
not only avarice, but the hypocrisy of his religious z eal
,
in weighing his coppers against his Christianity. The
precious document continues :
“ He replied that he had
no dread of the Inquisition , for he had offended no one
in his way of living and could not recall having said
anything wicked ; and , even if he had done so, he had
said it to me without any witness being present, and
therefore he did not fear that I could injure him in that
way, and, even if he should be handed over to the Inquisi
tion ,
they could only force him to resume his habit .
‘ So
you were a monk,
’
said 1. He replied ,
‘
I only took the

first habit, and therefore,
in
"
any case,
I c an readily adjust
This dramatic account of how Bruno let slip
that he had been a monk, how Mocenigo caught at it and
how Bruno lied concerning the final and irrevocable vow
hardly tallies with Bruno
’
s own account that he had con
s ulted his host as well as many priests as to his getting
to the Apostolic Chair and being allowed to live
\
in peace,
wearing the clerical habit, but not under monastic rule .
1
I followed up with, And how can you adjust your affairs
if you do not believe in the most Holy Trinity ;
if you
say such wicked things of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
if you
hold our souls to be made of filth and everything in the
world to be guided by Fate, as you have told me on several
occasions You must needs first adjust your Opinions, and
the rest will be easy ; and,
if you wish,
I will give you all
the aid I can ,
tha t you may know that, although you have
so broken your word and been so ungrateful for all my
kindness , I still wish in every way to be your friend .
’ At
this he only prayed me to set him free ;
if he had packed
his things and told me he wished to leave, he did not mean
it, but wished to bridle my impatience to be taught, wherein
I perpetually tormented him, and,
if I would set him at
liberty, he would teach me all he knew ; moreover, hewould
disclose the secret of all his works to me alone ; also,
that
he meditated writingothers, which should be beautiful and
exceptional ; he would be my slave with no further reward
than what I had given ; and,
if I wanted all he had in my
house,
it should be mine, for in every way he owed every
thing to me : all he wanted was a little book of conjurations
which I found among his writings .

“ The
Seals of Hermes and Ptolomy

THE TRIAL
THE evil lead given in the fourth century by the fifteen
ineffective edicts against heresy in order to weld the Em
pire into unity and protect it against those blind,
scarcely
conscious centrifugal forces which were apt to fight under
the more legible ensigns of religious differences persisted
throughout the Middle Ages . But it was not until the
Thirteenth Century that an organised Inquisition was first
instituted and the Church, holding the keys of heaven and
hell at its girdle and conscious of the duty of maintaining
its own supremacy and some sort of unity in Europe, acted
with free authority and made a systematic attempt to fetter
Opinion . Its proceedings became secret and mysterious ;
the victim disappeared as if the earth had silently swallowed
him,
and the issue was only apparent when he was restored
to the public gaz e in a procession of priests and godly men
conducting him to the stake . Written accusations were
accepted of anyone, and , while the accused might demand
a written account of the charges brought against him,
the
names of the accuser and of witnesses were with-held .
1
After a period of greater tolerance, at the instigation of
Don Inigo Lopez de Recalde, better known as Ignatius
Loyola,
founder of the order of Jesuits and a man wholly
devoted to the service of God, Paul III yielded to the
entreaties of Cardinal Carafa and instituted the Roman
Inquisition, 2 1 s t July, 1 54 2, on the imp roved, severe and
1 Bulls of Innocent IV, Cum Negoqi um and Li cet si eut
acoepimus .
264 GIORDANO BRUNO
It is believed that, at that time,
the Inquisitors met at the
Patriarchal Palace on the opposite side of the Rio di Palaz z o
to the prison and a little higher up . They sat under the
presidency of the Patriarch .
On Tuesday,
2 6th May,
1 59 2 ,
the Holy Tribunal met to
consider the case of Bruno . The judges were Laurentio
Priuli, the Patriarch, who had been Venetian Ambassador
at Paris during Bruno
’
s first Visit,
ten years before, and
who may have heard of or even seen him there ; Ludo
vico Taberna,
the Apostolic Nuncro,
the Very Reverend
Father Giovanni Gabrielle of Saluz z o, and Aloysio Fus cari
the Assessor . Ciotto, having been sworn, gave evidence
which , so far as his direct knowledge of Bruno went
, was
wholly favourable . But he had heard the prisoner spoken
ill of at Frankfurt . That was all he knew or could say con
cerning Giordano ;
if he knew more he would tell it . As
was customary he was sworn to silence and the Court rose .
It did not reassemble until Friday,
the 2 9th, and was
composed of the same members as before . Bri c tanus,
the
Flemish bookseller, an older man than C iotto by twelve
years (
he was knew nothing at all of Bruno
’
s views
ex cept hearsay . After adjourn ment for the mid-day meal
,
Bruno was brought in . He had lain three days in his cell .
The Clerk of the Court describes him as of ordinary height,
chestnut-coloured beard, and looking his age, about 40. Ciotto
had described him as little,
slenderly-built , with a black beard .
We know from Eglin and Alsted that he accompanied his
earnest and rapid S peech with lively gestures ; he had the
changing expression of a Southern Italian . Admonished to
tell the truth before cross-examination , he burst out,
“ I shall
tell the truth . Often have I been threatened with the Holy
Office and I deemed it a joke so I am quite ready to furnish
an account of myself.
” Then,
in answer to questions, he
commenced that story of his life and wanderings which has
THE TRIAL 2 65
been incorporated in thes e chapters , until the hour was
late, when he was sent back to his place with the usual
warnin g .
” 1
The Inquisitor required Mocenigo to furnish more matter
he must write down with extreme carefulness all that Bruno
had s aid against our Catholic faith .
” The document i s a
subtle commingling of truth with its distortion . Dafed the
same day of Bruno
’
s first examination,
it affirms that Bruno
had pronounced the priesthood degenerate from Apostolic
practice, manifesting violence and not love towards heretics .
The world could not remain in ignorance and without a good
religion . Truly the Catholic religion was more acceptable
to him than others
i
; but all needed much reform . Soon the
world would take its own reform on itself,
for it could not
continue s o corrupt . He hoped much from the King of
Navarre, and therefore he was anxious to publish his works
and get credit ; for hims elf would lead that coming time . He
would not always be poor, but would enjoy the goods of
others . There is greater ignorance than ever was afore
time, since men now teach what they do not understand,
namely that God is a Trinity, which is impossible and
blas phemous against the Majesty of God . When I told
him to be silent and hasten on with what he had to do for
me, because I was a Catholic and he a Lutheran, and I
could nOt abide him, he replied, Oh, you will see what your
faith will do for you ,
’
and,
laughing,
‘
await the Judgment,
when the dead shall arise you will get the reward of your
righteousness .
’ And on another occasion , he said,
‘ This
Republic has a reputation for great wisdom it should deal
with the monastic revenues in the French manner ;
there
the nobles enjoy the monas tic revenues and the friars live
on broth . The friars of to-day are all asses, and to let
them enjoy so much wealth is a great sin .
”
(This stroke
1 Doc. vi i .
2 66 GIORDANO BRUNO
was certain to tell . )
“ Also he told me that ladies pleased
him well ; but he had not yet reached Solomon
’
s number ;
the Church sinned in making a wickedness of that which
was of great service in Nature, and which,
in his View, was
highly meritorious .
” 1
Next day, Saturday 3oth May, Bruno was again fetched
from prison . The Apostolic Nuncio was represented by ,
hi s
vicar, Dom Livio Passero
! Bruno, having been sworn to
tell the truth , continued the concise, matter of fact and
straightforward story of his life , making a natural mistake
here and there about the length of time he stayed at this or
that place . Parenthetically, he observes that he does not
endorse all the works he has written— a statement which he
repeats later on , adding : I have uttered myself and handled
matters too philosophically, wrongly, not sufficiently after
the manner of a good Christian , and,
in particular, I have
taught and maintained in some of these works philosophical
doctrines concerning what
, according to the Christian faith ,
should be attributed to the power, wisdom and goodness of
God ; founding my doctrine on sensible experience and
reason and not on faith .
” He goes on to say, probably in
reply to a question :
“ This is a general observation for
details ,
I will look U p my writings ;
for I cannot now
recollect any particular passages or teaching ; but I will
reply to questions as they shall come back to me .
” 3 We
gather,
then ,
that he was allowed to refer to the seiz ed
books . After a lengthy sitting , he was given the customary
serious warning and taken back to his cell .
Next day the officers of the Inquisition obtained a deposi
tion from Fra Domenico which confirmed Bruno
'
s statements
about their conversation together . The Court sat again
on the z ud June, another State Assessor, one Sebastian
1 Doc. vi i i .
2 Cigogna I scri z i on i Ven ete,
i v, p. 41 7 .
3 Doc. i x.
2 68 GIORDANO BRUNO
universe to be infinite as result of the infinite divine power
for I think it unworthy ofdivine goodness and power to
have produced merely one finite world when it was able to
bring into being an infinity of worlds .
1 Wherefore I have
expounded that there is an endless number of individual
worlds like our earth . I regard it
, with Pythagoras ,
as a
star, and the moon ,
the p lanets and the stars are similar to
it,
the latter being of endless number. All these bodies
make an infinity of worlds ;
they constitute the infinite
whole in infinite space, an infinite universe,
that is to say,
containing innumerable worlds . So that there is an infinite
measure in the universe and an infinite multitude of worlds .
But this may be indirectly Opposed to truth according to
the faith .
Within this universe I place a universal Providence ,
whereby everything lives, grows , acts and abides in its
perfection . And I understand this in a two-fold way : one ,
after the fashion of the S pirit which is completely present
in the whole body and in every part thereof. This I call
Nature,
the shadow and record of the Divine . The other
manner is the inconceivable way in which God, an essence ,
presence and power,
is in all and above all, not as part, not
as spirit, but unspeakably.
Now,
I understand all attributes to be one and the same
in Deity,
and, with theologians and the greatest thinkers,
I
conceive of three attributes ; power, wisdom and goodness
or, mind
”
(
intuitive Power),
“ comprehension and Love .
Things are through mind ;
they are ordered and are dis
tinct through intellect ;
they are in harmonious proportion
through universal love,
in all and above all . There is
nothing that doth not shine in being, any more than any
thing is beautiful without the presence ofbeauty ; wherefore
nothing can exist shorn from the divine presence . But
1 Cfr. I nfi ni to, P roem. Epi st .
THE TRIAL 2 69
distinctions in the Divinity are made by the method of Di s
cursive Thought and are not reality.
I understand, with Aristotle,
that all which exists depends
on the First Cause,
so that to call it a
' creation is not con
tradi ctory, as St . Thomas explains . Whether understood
as external or In time, all is the effect of the first Caus e and
is not independent .
”
Bruno next , supporting himself by quotations from Holy
Writ and Virgil
, endeavours to reconcile the doctrine of the
Trinity with his philosophy . That attribute or essential
characteristic which the Church calls the Father is Will or
Power ;
the Son or the Word is the intellect, understanding ;
the Holy Spirit is love— the life of the universe,
the Soul
of the World , whence issues all that has life . All things,
sOuls and bodies , are immortal as to their substance,
1 nor
18 there any other death than dispersion and re-inte
grati on .
” 2
Asked if he held Father, Son and Spirit to be One in
Essence but distinct Persons, he replied that he had doubted
in private concerning the distinct personalities of the two
latter . Indeed the term Person was declared by St .
Augustine to be new in his time . He had doubted the
doctrine from his eighteenth year, but had never denied ,
or taught or written against it . Asked if he had doubts
concerning the First Person , he replied Never he had
always held the doctrine of
’
the faithful Christian in that
regard . In answer to interrogatories, he said he had
doubted and wrestled in spirit concerning the incarnation ,
but had never doubted that the Son was one in essence
1 He would seem to use the term substance in its Aristotelian ,
logi cal sense to express substrate or the i ngredi ent, one knows not
what , ofconcrete being as such, and not i n the scholastic sen se ofthe
n ature ofthe i ndividual thi ng.

2 70 GIORDANO BRUNO
with the First Person , while
-
the Spirit,
if indistinct as to
essence, was not inferior, since all the attributes of God
are also those of Son and Spirit . He had merely
quoted
the Opinions of Arius in his youth at Naples as being those
of Arius .
The time had come to adjourn for the mid-day meal and
Bruno was taken back to his cell after the invariable
warning .
On reassembling the Nuncio was represented by his
Vicar, as he had been on May 3oth, and the Patriarch by
his Vicar . Questioned , Bruno repeated his admi s sIOn that
much objectionable matter might be extracted from his
works but never had he impugned the Catholic faith . He
had always claimed to reason by natural intelligence and
not as a theologian .
1 He had reasoned philosophically
and had merely quoted the heretical opinions of others .
He repeated that he had gravely doubted the Word becom
ing flesh . The examination being pushed he said :
“ To
make clearer what I said this morning,
I have held and
believed that there is a distinct Godhead in the Father,
in
the Word and in Love, which is the Divine Spirit ; and,
in
Essence,
these three are one ; but I have never been able
to grasp the three being really Persons and have doubted
it . Augustine says,
‘ we utter the name of Person with
dread when we speak of divine matters , and use it because
we are obliged ; nor have I found the term applied in the
Old or New Testament .
” As to the Incarnation , he thought
the Divine Word was present in the humanity of Christ ;
but he could never comprehend the union of the Infinite
Real with the finite in the way in which body and soul are
one single reality, but had swayed to and fro as to the
ineffable manner thereof, and never as to the authority of
Scripture which declares the Word was made flesh and I S
1 Cfr . Causa, Di a l . I I I Eroi ci
, Di al . I ,

2 72 GIORDANO BRUNO
tual soul does not pass from body to body, but goes to
Paradise, Purgatory, or Hell
; but I have thought deeply,
as a Philosopher, how,
since the soul does not exist
,
without
body and does not exist in the body,
it may pass from body
to body even as matter may pass from mass to mass ; which ,
if not true, bears a close resemblance to the opinion of
Pythagoras . It is obvious that he would claim for the
initiated the right to hold theological doctrine in a different
sense from that in which the uninitiated take it .
Whereupon the Court puts the sardonic question :
“ Are
you a skilled theologian and acquainted with Catholic
decisions Answer : Not much ,
1 having pursued philo
S ophy, which has been my avocation .
” Had he poured
scorn on theologians ! No ; on the contrary, he had
condemned Protestant teachings so far as they departed
from those of Rome, and had always upheld the theologians
of the Church , St . Thomas Aquinas before all . He had
read heretical books and animadverted on them . As to
the doctrine of good works, he quoted passages from his
own writings, which maintained that works , no less than
faith , were necessary to salvation . Since he gave the
precise page,
it is evident that the books lay on the table
or that he was allowed them in his cell for the preparation
of his defence
!
Had he said that monks did not make their lives conform
to those of the apostles ! I have said nothing of the
kind , nor held that view,
’
and therewith ,
says the Inqui
si tori al record,
“ he threw U p his hands and was agitated
because such questions were asked of him .
"
The judge-prosecutors pushed him hard with Mocenigo
’
s
charges , which they brought forward one by one . Bruno

It i s true . Later i n the exami nation he attributes to Joachim of
Flora a doctri ne whi ch Joachim expressly repudi ated .

THE TRIAL 73
remembered sayi ng that the preaching, example, and
miracles of the Apostles effected more than the Church
’
s
appeal to force to-day does ; but his works showed that
he supported the dis cipll n e of the Church against heresy .
Closely pressed as to the different method of the Church i n
Apostolic times , he replied that perhaps hearts were harder
to-day,
and so , although there were exemplary Christians ,
our wicked and perverse generation would not listen .
Asked if Christ wrought his
,
miracles by magic , he raised
both hands and cried out : What is this Who invented
these devilries I have never even thought such a thing .
0 God
'
l what is this ! I would rather be dead than have
said anything of the kind .
” The gibe concerning the Last
Judgment which Mocenigo attributed to him was then
brought up, and Bruno exclaimed :
“ I have never said
these
“
things . My Lord ,
look through my books . They
are profane enough ; but you will not find a trace of this ;
nor has it entered my head .
”
Asked as to carnal sin , he had spoken of fornication as
the smallest of such sins and joked about it in frivolous
company. He had never blamed the Church » for its moral
code,
but accepted its teaching on the subject . Changing
the subject ,
the Court then informed Bruno that he must
not be surprised at the questions which were asked ,
for he
had dwelt in heretical countries , had h ad many dealings
with heretics and had attended their sermons . Such was
their comprehension of the impressionability and lack of
personal. force of the great original thinker before them !
He had admitted,
they said, enough to make the allegations
against him credible . These were enumerated . Let him
take heed and make full
, Open and faithful confession in
order to be received into the bosom of Holy Mother Church
and be made a member of Jesus Christ . But it would be
a marvel if persistence in his obstinate denial did not lead
S
2 74 GIORDANO BRUNO
to the usual end of the impenitent . The Holy Office was
desirous of bringing to the light, by its piety and Christian
love,
those who were in darkness, and of deliverance from
the crooked way to the straight path of etern al life . At
last it must have been clear, even to Bruno,
that the noose
was tightening .
“ So may God pardon me,
” he replied,
every one of my answers to every question has been true
so far as my memory has served me ; but,
for my greater
s a ti sfaction , I will again pass my life in review, and,
if I
have said or done anything against the Catholic Christian
Faith,
I will frankly confess it . I have said what is just and
true, and I shall continue to say it . I am certain the contrary
shall never be proved against me . He put a vastly dif
feren t interpretation on the Catholic Christian Faith and
what he had written about it to that of the Church itself.
Next day (
June 3rd)
the Court reassembled ,
the Patriarch
and Nuncio being again represented by their vicars . The
interrogatories of the previous day were again read over and
Bruno was asked if he were guilty with regard to any of
the charges indicated . He replied that he had indeed broken
fasts , which were not kept by heretics, for he did not know
the appointed days ex cept when among Catholics : he had
had scruples , but punctilious observance would have excited
ridicule . He was of opinion that every faithful Catholic
should adhere to the Calendar ; but he called God to
witness that he had not offended in this respect because
of despising such Observances . He had attended the
sermons of Protestants out of intellectual curiosity, and
had n ev er s at with heretics at their breaking of bread
or at their other usages . Pushed on this point he replied :
“ Wherein I have erred ,
I have told the truth, and you
will never find that this is not so . There are plenty of
Catholics in those parts who drop their own religious
Observances without becoming heretics . Cross-examined
2 76 GIORDANO BRUNO
for him (Bruno)
to lecture publicly, which the former king
had allowed . With regard to his compliment to Eliz abeth ,
he neglected to point out that if he had called her di va
he had also called Rudolf II di vus . He had no recollection
of having said that he wished to be
“ captain
”
and secure
the wealth of others ; his was no martial disposition, and
what he wanted was not wealth but to follow philo sophy
and the sciences .
Throughout the day,
the Court had repeated ,
in varied
forms, questions which had been asked before and to which
the prisoner had surely replied sufficiently . It was now
demanded of him if he abjured and hated his heresies .
Bruno answered :
“ I hate and detest all the errors I
have at any time committed as regards the Catholic Faith
and decrees of Holy Church , and I repent having done ,
held ,
said , believed or doubted anythi ng Catholic . I
pray this Holy Tribunal that, aware of my infirmity,
it
will admit me into the bosom of the Church , providing me
with remedies proper to salvation and shewing mercy .
”
We shall see how he received both .
The facts as to his flight from Naples were now extracted
from him,
and he was removed to his
‘
cell.
At a short sitting the nex t day, whereat the Nuncio and
Patriarch themselves were present with the Father Inqui
sitor and the State-Assessor, Barbadi co,
the eviden ce was
read over to Bruno who replied that it was accurately
reported and he had nothing to add . Asked about Divina
tion , he ex plained about the transcription found among his
belongings . Asked if he had an enemy, he replied he
could think of none,
except Mocenigo, against whose tru
culent and vindictive behaviourhe inveighed, exposing what
he supposed to be its cause .

THE TRIAL 2 77
It was not until three weeks later that the judges re
assembled, Thomas Morosini now representing the State .
The prisoner was not brought before the Court, but the
entirely favourable deposition of the distinguished patrician
and scholar, Andrea Morosini was taken . Ciotto was
called and confirmed Bruno
’
s statement that he intended
to present a book he was writing to the Pope in person .
1
After two tedious months in a prison-cell, doubly lacerat
ing to a spirit so enamoured of freedom and so restless,
not to speak of the doubt and dread which would attend
any solitary prisoner of the Inquisition , Bruno was brought
again before the same authorities as on the last occasion ;
with the addition of a second State-Assessor . He was
as ked
i
if, having had time to reflect, he could tell the truth
better.
v No, he had nothing to add . He was informed
that hi s protracted and contumacious apostasy placed him
under the grave s us p1c10n of the Holy Chair (
so there had
been communications with the Pope and Curia)
. Perhaps
there was more than appeared behind the statements he
had made . He must purge his conscience . The prisoner
replied that his confessions and writings were indeed such
as to rouse suspicions of heresy ; he had always felt re
morse and wished to amend his ways, wherefore he had
sought a less irksome path than that of returning to strict
monastic rule and had hoped to make himself acceptable
to His Holiness, so as to live in more freedom, yet as a
Catholic priest . There had been no slight intended to
the Fait h, but dread of the rigours of the Holy Office and
love of liberty. But, he was told,
“ had your desire been
sincere you would not have lived so long in France and
other Catholic countries and here in Venice without having
consulted some prelate whereas you went on teaching false
an d heretical doctrine up to now .
” Bruno referred the
1 Docs . xv, xvi
.
2 78 GIORDANO BRUNO
judges to his deposition to prove that he had indeed con
s ulted prelates and Catholic Fathers . His conduct i n
Venice had been without fault ; he had discussed phi lo
sophy with many patri c 1an s , as his judges might ascertain
he had ex pressed his disapproval of Protestantism ; he
designed to be absolved so as to live, but not cloistered ,
among the monks of his native province . He believed
Mocenigo, and he alone of men, was his accuser . Being
told that he had been so long time an apostate and dwelt
so many years among heretics that he might easily be
1
a
wicked man , wherefore he must prepare to purge his con
science , he replied that it might be he had erred more than he
could recollect, but truly,
though he had thoroughly searched
himself for faults, he could not find them . He had readily
confessed all he knew of; he was in their Lordships
’
hands ;
he did not know what the needful penalty might be ; he was
ready with his soul to receive it .
His great scheme of getting the ear of an enlightened
Pope through high influence and the presentation of an
ex planatory and illuminating book had failed ,
like all his
many attempts to reconcile himself with the Church .
Trai torously
' d eliv ered to the Inquisition , at first he felt
little or no fear, for he was convinced of his own integrity
and blindly self-assured of his own essential Catholicity
But now he felt with the Theban King
All I c an to uch
I s falling, falling round me, and o
’
erhead
Intolerable destiny descends .
”
He cast himself on the mercy of the Inquisition . Falling on
his knees he humbly demanded pardon of God and the
Court . Might any punishment be given pri vately, and
public disgrace not attach to the habit he had worn .
Ifhis life were spared he promised so to reform it as to

BRUNO AND THE I NQUI S ITORS . THE REP UBLIC AND
THE POPE
LET us pause to examine a little more . clos ely the conduct
of the Inquisition , and the line taken by the prisoner .
Like the proceedings of the Venetian Three,
those of the
Inquisition were shrouded in secrecy and silence, and the
Court was shielded by the terror which it inspired .
1
Every witness , every official was muz z led by a sacred
oath . Morosini i n his history makes no mention of Bruno .
The judges allowed their prisoner no advocate
! The onus
of proving his innocence fell on him alone ; but he had
no means of communicating with the outer world ;
the
names of his accuser and of witnesses were withheld from
him,
3 and he was given no opportunity of cross-ex amining
the witnesses , who were heard and questioned by the Court
only . His prosecutors were his judges , and they were past
masters in the art of luring the victim on until he made
some fatal admission . They were ecclesiastics who pro
fessed that the sufferings of our mortal life weigh as
nothing compared with eternal blessedness or the tortures
of the damned .
“ Etern um s erva n s sub pectore vulnus ,

x ofcruel absolutism and crushing retaliation which are so
heartily aroused in the most cultured minds when some
darling prejudice or wonted privilege is assailed .
Yet the Court seems to have acted with caution and with
honest intention, according to its lights . The inquisitors
practically restricted their enquiry to the charges contai ned
in Mocenigo
’
s denunciations and conducted it with as much
moderation as was usual in the civil courts of the period .
The Court was more painstaking than is many a modern
Court of Justice . The case presented difficult points,
so the
prisoner
’
s philosophical doctrines were lightly skimmed
over. Perhaps they were
"
merely put aside for the present .
The judges would naturally be perplexed, and it may be
for this reason that they communicated with Rome .
1 For ,
unlike the rebel-churches,
the heretrix of Imperial Rome
has always secured by organization and subordination that
its ministers shall deal only with those matters in which
they are fully competent .
On the whole,
the depositions would seem to have been
carefully and accurately recorded
! They were read over
to the prisoner, who thus had opportunities of discovering
and correcting any injurious mistake . An easy evasion by
Bruno of the charge of having broken his obligation to
celibacy was fought shy of by the judges;
for sexual im
morality, even l n the priesthood , was never pursued
during the Counter-Reformation , or at any time, with
that implacable rancour with which heresy was hunted
down .

But, as the trial proceeds, we find the attitude of the
j udges becoming more and more sinister ; accusations are
brought up again when they have been answered and
apparently disposed of;
less and less is the mask of im
partiality maintained .
What was Bruno
’
s attitude The Canon Law recognised
two sorts of apostasy— a fi de and a ma n da tis Dez
i— that of
unbelief and that of violating monastic vows . He con
s idered himself guilty of having violated the latter a nd less
apostasy only ; and this was within the sole jurisdiction of
his Order, and the Inquisition had nothing to do with i t .
1
The Roman form of the Tribunal was not allowed in Venice
he felt himself secure, and when dragged before the Venetian
Court, he was confident, fearles s, a nd franker than was wonted
even with innocent persons . Untaught by so long and bitter
experience, he believed that such highly qualified scholars
and thinkers as the men who tried him would be as devoted
to the pursuit of truth as himself, as eager for
“ large draughts
of intellectual day, as tolerant and broad-minded, and as
ready to follow the Divine Counsellor within them .
” 2 He
remembered only the long periods of intelligent toleration
by which the Church had distinguished itself, and he forgot
the Council of Trent . He boldly expounded his philosophy
and science he might be mistaken on this or that point, but
he believed he presented what intelligent men would discover
to be truth , or at least a reasonable view of God and of
Nature . So ,
the first man since the triumph of Christianity
to return openly to the independence of the old Greek
thinkers , he claimed the right to ex pound philosophy as
essentially superior to theology and independent of it . He
maintained his right to think for himself; he would not
passively receive the op1n 10n s of others . He referred h i s
judges to his latest works . He was anxious to subscribe

though very necessary and of supreme practical importance .

His temperament was scientific,
’
not pietistic ,
though ex
tremely reverent ; he fought shy of all fanatic ways, yet ,
like all the men of the Renaissance, he discovered traces of
truth in every singular creed . Ancient cults had a certain
charm for Bruno ;
the religion of the Classic world was
tolerant ;
it glorified humanity,
it rejoiced in the fulness of
life the Bacchic rout of its deities set forth the persistent
power and vital immanence of the Godhead ;
2 the ancient
Egyptians had also seen God in Nature . Christianity was
inferior in so far as it had become a cult of ascetic saints
and dead men
’
s bones ;
so far as it mutilated human joy and
noble activities
! It had become obscurantist, and the Pope
had pushed his pretensions unduly
! Yet the emphasis it
laid on Divine love raised it above other imperfect ad umbra
tions of the On e Perfect Light . Only a purgation of the
excrement, superstition , and a granting of complete tolerance
to the qualified and judicious thinker were needed .
The opposition between R evelation and reason had been
clearly discerned at a very early period in the history of the
Church . Tertullian affirmed the former to be
“ credible
because inconsistent ; assured because impossible . I believe

secure freedom for human reason ,

but the distinct and superior claim ofFaith was acknow

ledged . The doctrine had not yet been impugned, and
Bruno frequently distinguished between Catholic and Philo
s 0phi c doctrine in his defence . But he did not accept though
he did not disclaim it . Ofthe line of Lully and Cusanus,
he took a higher ground . Lully had maintained the possi
bili ty of demonstrating Catholic truth by . the exercise of
reason ; Cusanus had made some attempt to explain away
the current theology ; Bruno scorned theologic subtleties
and disputes ;
1 his conviction was that dogma was the
mere symbol of reason , and that intuition and reason ,
so far
from being opposed , are the two sides of what should be the
great and growing body of organised knowledge .
As early as the second century certain followers of
Aristotle began to interpret the Hebrew Scriptures in
terms of Greek Philosophy. Later, Philo systematiz ed
allegorIcal renderings of them . Tertullian , Augustine and
the early Christian apologists availed themselves of the
doctrine of
“ language of accommodation .
” 2 St . Thomas
Aquinas , whom Bruno especially respected, expounded and
Dante populariz ed the doctrine that both Scripture and Holy
Church condescend to the weakness of human faculty .
3 The
best minds in the Middle Ages took the symbolic view that
the world was subtly and mystically interpenetrated by the
Divine Spirit, which revealed itself in many imperfect forms
they regarded Virgil as inspired in the same way as Isaiah ,
though less fully and persistently . Classic mythology was
symbolic to Dante and others ; an uncertain twilight, pene
tra ted by flashes from the high white star of truth . This
belief, Bruno accepted . Authority still reigned in the Re

naissance, and Bruno defended himself by quoting Virgil
,
the Bible,
the Fathers and Pythagoras . But such philosophy
was not for the vulgar ;
“ Let simplicity and moral fable
remain .
” 1 So we find Bruno ,
fortified by example, not
infertile in gloss nor wanting in reservations . Such ex
pedi en ts are not entirely unknown in attempts to reconcile
dogma and reason . He endeavoured to make his peace
with the Inquisition he took care not to e x pound the sense
in which he accepted heaven , purgatory and hell
; he did
not develop the veiled hint , given in the Spaccio , as to the
Divine Virtue merely communicating itself in the person of
Christ
!
Roman Christianity was the organiz ed and historic bond
of unity among the western peoples ; he had been born and
bred in the Catholic Faith . I t was a system entwined
round his heart by early associations ; branded into his
brain by that early appeal to the senses which is as ofreality
itself. It had buried itself in the depths of his nature, be
come bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh . Deprived of
corporate communion he had been for years doubly an ex ile
from home . Catholic authority had judged him to sin , and ,
as a good member of human society, as a good Catholic, he
accepted the judgment
, however mistaken it might be . And,
while he would not sacrifice any assured philOS Ophi c con
v i c ti on , he was in deadly peril
; his chance of being received
into the bosom of the Church was n
‘
ow narrowed down to
what might happen at this trial . Surely at worst, he might
hope for life and be allowed a life of quiet study if he did
what he had always purposed doing— confessed his fault
3
He fell on his knees and submitted , but he did not retract .
Seven years before he had written : As to my faith I hold
i t a most proper thing to declare and affirm with theologi ans

forwarded to Rome .
1 Perhaps it was not rel igi ous z eal
alone which prompted this action . Rome never missed a
'
politic opportunity of asserting Papal claims over a govern
ment which so often defied them and with which there was
an enduring territorial dispute .
Five days later, September 17th,
the letter was read at a
sitting of the Venetian Inquisition , Tommaso Morosini being
the State Assessor present . It behoved the Sacred Tribunal
to act warily : they waited until the next Roman post arrived
so that it was not until eleven days later that the Vicar of
the Venetian Patriarch ,
the Father Inquisitor and Morosini
appeared before the Doge and Council
! The Vicar pro
fessed that they had not liked to bear the prisoner away to
Rome without informing the Council first . This was a
device to disguise the aggression of Rome : Venetian con
sent had to be sought for extradition . The true bias of the
judges now appears . They urge that Bruno is not merely
guilty of heresy, but a leader therein ; he had written books
in which he praised Eliz abeth of England and other heretical
princes and in which there was much that was inimical to
religion ,
even if taken philOS Ophically ; he was an apostate
monk , who had dwelt many years in those heretical parts ,
Geneva and England , and he had been pursued for heresy
before at Naples and Rome . The Vicar added that he
desired the matter should not be delayed, for a boat was
just about to set off. The Doge refused to be hustled : he
replied that the matter should receive due consideration
!
I t was not the first time the Venetian government had had
difficulties with the z ealous Inquisition ; when Sixtus V
was Inquisitor in the city they had demanded his recall
by Rome .
In the afternoon of the same day the Father Inquisitor
came again ,
and was put offwith the statement that, seeing
1 Doc. xvi i i .
2 Doc. xi x .

I bi d .
occupied with many grave matters ,
they had not been able
to decide about i t .
1
A few days later, Oct . 7th, a copy of the Roman de
mand was sent by the with secret
/
in
s truction s to Donato, Venetian Ambassador . The Three
sign themselves + 1 1 7, —2 and -6 . The request could not
be complied ,with ;
for the demand was an infringement on
the Authority of the Venetian Inquisition , and if complied
with, a very bad precedent would be set . Moreover it
interfered with the liberty of Venetian subjects . The
Ambassador is to convey this to the Cardinal with due
compliments
!
Donato replied on the l oth that he would carry out these
commands : should any incredible argument turn Up, he
would deal with it discreetly
! Three months passed, during
which Bruno lay in his prison cell at Venice and there was
diplomatic fencing between Pope and Ambassador at Rome .
On Dec . 2 2 n d the Nuncio returned to the charge . He
appeared before the Venetian College, repeated some of the
“
heretical charges , and added another calculated to appeal to
commercial instincts : some of Bruno
’
s books purported
falsely to have been printed at Venice . His Holiness
desires to have the prisoner in Rome to expedite justice
and begs
’
the Doge to extradite him . The Nuncio was
followed by Donato, who had returned to Venice. He
recounted his interview with Clement ; he had told the
Pope that justice was invariably done at the Venetian In
qui si tion ;
for the Pope was always represented there by his
Nuncio, who could always obtain i nstructions from Rome,
and,
in fact, did so ; he failed to see any necessity for
extradition . Whereat the Pope appeared to be satisfied ,
and never mentioned the subject again . But Severina and
1 Doc. xx .
2 Doc. xxi .
3 Doc. xxi
i
.
T
2 90 GIORDANO BRUNO
the Inquisitors were not men to be easily put off. The
Nuncio now spoke again , urging that the man was no
Venetian but a Neapolitan ,
charged long ago at Naples and
Rome with the gravest offences . On previous occasions ,
more than two doz en cases had been sent on from Venice
to the Holy Roman Tribunal
, which ,
the Nuncio reminded
the College, was the head one . The man was merely a
friar, and therefore the desire of the Pope should not be
denied to him ; moreover the culprit was a notorious
heresiarch and guilty of vile offences which he (
the Nuncio)
would not speak about , as only the matter of faith was to
the point . Undoubtedly the Venetian Inquisitor should deal
with ordinary cases arising within the Venetian State, but
not with this grave case, begun aforetime in Naples and
continued in Rome .
1
The Nuncio was informed that their Lordships would
confer,
and he was assured that it was desired to give His
Holiness every satisfaction possible
!
The Government was somewhat perplexed . The Papacy
had increased its temporal power by consolidating the
States under its rule,
and, at the same time ,
the carrying out
of the Decrees of Trent had added to its S piritual prestige .
An open rupture with Rome was very undesirable, but the
Venetian Republic must be kept inviolate from the ever
recurring attempts at aggression which marked the policy
of the Pope. So the government consulted with the pro
curator, Federigo Contarini
, an ingenious lawyer,
to find
a way out . He appeared before the College on Jany . 7th
1 59 3 . After recounting facts as to the first processes
against Bruno, he added that he escaped to England ,
where he lived after the custom of that island, and after
wards
(
sic)
i n Geneva,
leading apparently a licentious and
1 There i s no men tion ofthe alleged Vercelli process .
2 Doc. xxi i

.
2 9 2 GIORDANO BRUNO
Later on in the same day,
it was resolved by the Three
to n otify the Nuncio and the Venetian Ambassador at
Rome that,
it being found suitable, especially in such an
unusual case as that of an escaped prisoner from the
Neapolitan and Roman Inquisitions,
to give satisfaction
to His Holiness , Bruno shall be delivered over to the
Nuncio . On the 9th Jany .
, a letter S i gned like the former
one in a
’
secret code, was sent to Paruta , now Ambassador
at Rome,
instructing him to make capital out of the trans
action he is to represe nt to the Pope that the extradition
is an expression of the filial reverence the Republic bears
for His Beatitude, and to commiserate with him on his recent
illness and express the joy felt at his recovery.
1
The compliments were returned : on the 16th Paruta
replies that the extradition was news to His Holiness,
who ex pressed himself as highly gratified . Clement diplo
matically added that he greatly desired to be in har
mony with the Republic , and he hoped that,
thenceforward ,
it would not give him very hard bones to gnaw,
lest he
should be accused of yielding too much to his great affec
tion . The Nuncio responded with correct expressions of
devotion
!
So the prisoner was consigned to the Nuncio and for
warded by sea to Ancona , whence he was transported
along a fork of the Flami n i an Way and along that
historic and S plendid approach to Rome . Released from
eight months of captivity in a cell
,
some gleam of hope
may have visited him as he breathed the keen wintry
ai r and saw the ever green valleys of Central Italy and
the sun playing on the waters of the Tiber. There lay
before him dismal years to test his sincerity and firmness
and the final
,
ironic pageantry of a triumphal parade to
the stake .

which an apostate monk might hope for was perpetual
imprisonment . The Inquisitors were instructed to be
merciful . Their manual speaks of the Institution as not
desiring the death of the sinner, but rather that he should
turn from his wickedness and live .
1
The earliest of the documents still preserved in the
Archives of the Holy Office at Rome bears the date Jan . 14,
The Congregation consisted of eight cardinals ,
seven coadjutors and the official notary. Eight heretical
propositions had been extracted from Bruno
’
s books and from
the process by the Commissary and Bellarmi n . These
were read, and it was decided that certain ones , not named
in the document, should be selected,
so that it might be
seen whether he would abjure them . A search was to be
made in the process and in his works for other heretical
propositions .
Among the Congregation were Cardinal Santoro di Santa
Severina and the great Jesuit luminary Robert Bellarmin .
Santoro had been a candidate for the Papacy ;
so sure was
he of election that he had chosen his title— the same assumed
by his rival Aldobrandi ni
; his naturally bitter temperament
was not thereby improved . Bellarmin was one of the
first learned men to weaken the mediaeval conception of
Papal empire but he was unaware of the real nature and
importance of the new principles he invoked ; he was
always ready to employ his vast erudition and intellectual
dexterity in the service of obscurantism ; he it was who
took the main responsibility on himself of denouncing the
Copernican theory, who distinguished himself by pers ecut
i ng Sarpi and Galileo and who added certain works on
Natural Scienc e by distinguished men to the Index

to refute Mocenigo and that the works published abroad
were sent for and carefully examined, which would take
time .
1 As Mc In ty re remarks,
the books were not hard to
come by, and it would not require six years to find enough
material to condemn him if that were desired .
” 2 But was
it desired, ardently desired ! Fanatics may be, and often
are, conscientious and painstaking the doctrine of the Two
fold truth was not yet officially condemned ;
the relationship
philosophy should bear to theology, a thorny subject
, not
offi cially determined, and Clement was by nature conciliatory
and diplomatic , one who would perceive the value of de
mon s tra tin g by example the liberal bearing of Rome towards
thinkers could Bruno but be brought to bridle his tongue
and make himself subservient to the Authority of that
Church which he had never renounced . Brun nhofer thinks
that the
“ Seven Liberal Arts
” may have been already
written and have proved in some measure acceptable to
Clement
,
as furnishing a plausi ble alliance between philo
sophy and religion . There could hardly have been anyone
at once so powerful and so friendly to Bruno as to have
intervened on his behalf. Perchance, however, some of the
Princes of the Church may have perceived the essential
sincerity of the man in believing he was genuinely Catholic ,
and the strength of his desire for reconciliation . But,
in the
absence of documents, speculation is idle . The Church has
never acted precipitately its wont is to await the unfolding
of events and act at the appropriate season . And doubtless
it had its own good reasons for delay.
Forty days had been granted, but more than nine and a
half months were allowed to pass— evidence both as to the
skilful dialectic,
courage and firmness of the prisoner and
the no less persistent effort of the theologians to break

him down . For the times ,
the lenity shown was phe
nomen al . But it must not be forgotten that the Inquisitor
’
s
manual directs that
“ if the culprit deny the indictments and
these be not fully proved and he, during the term a ssigned
to him to prepare hi s defence, have not cleared himself from
the imputations which result from the process,
it is necessary
to have the truth out of him by a rigorous examination .
” 1
The case of Campanella shows what
“ rigorous examina
tion
” meant . Whether the sardonic irony of torture was
applied to the man who had s ung of heroic enthusiasm and
held it the acme of human greatness to rise above all
sensibility
to pain
2 we do not know . Ifso, he remained
steadfast and unsubdued .
On Dec . a l st Bruno was brought in person before
the Congregation , which numbered nine cardinals,
six co
adjutors and the notary. He was
“ heard concerning all
his pretensions .
” Says that he ought not to renounce
nor will he
’
do so there is nothing for him to renounce and
he knows not what he should renounce . The very illus
trious were still patient (Santoro and Bellarmi n were
among them) ;
they Ordered that hi s
“ blind and false
doctrine should be made manifest to him, and a ppointed

possible .
” 5
The Pope himself presided at a Congregation held on
January 20th 1600. It was reported that Bruno was
settled in his resolve not to abjure, asserting that he had

further measures be proceeded with, sentence passed and
the said Brother Jordan handed over to the secular arm .
” 4
There is a further record of this having been done on
Feb . 8th .
There are reasons for the final condemnation which
readily suggest themselves,
though those for the long
delay which preceded it remain a mystery . The apostate
monk demanded free enquiry into truth , unprejudiced and
unaffected by theologic authority. And h e was regarded
as a heresiarch,
the possible leader of a new sect,
the
fomenter of a new discord within the Church that had
already suffered so much in purse , prestige and power
from the sectaries of the Reformation .
The sentence was publicly declared the next day .
Gaspar Schopp , a scholar and recent convert to Rome,
was present . He was informed that the culprit had been
about two years in prison . He says the Cardinals and
Coadjutors were assembled together at the Monastery of
the Minerva . The Governor of Rome represented the

office of formally stripping a priest of his insignia and
station should have been singularly unpleasant ; but it
was by no means unprofitable . The general register of
Pontifical expenses bears the record that the bishop of
Sidonia received 2 7 scudi for the degradation of Giordano
Bruno, heretic .

in the usual formula :

wont to secure its purpose while veiling its infamy. When
all these things were done, writes Schopp,

years the only account of the tragedy was that of Gaspar
Schopp , and Catholic apologists declared the letter to be
a forgery and that Bruno had only been burned in effigy
!
It was long suspected, however,
that some document relat
ing to the execution might be found in the Archives of the
Brotherhood of Pity of St . John the Beheaded , who were
wont to accompany heretics to the stake and use the last
chance of moving an obdurate soul and ensure to it
“ a
happy journey.
”
It was stoutly denied that any such
record existed, and examination of the Archives was
refused to many of the most eminent Italian scholars . But
when
‘ Crispi was in power he desired to inquire into the

finances of the Brotherhood . They thought that, as so
many applications had been made concerning Bruno,
this
was what Crispi was at, and forthwith ,
in order to avoid
further inconvenient i nvestigations ,
the Royal Commissioner
was informed of the presence of an entry concerning him in
their registers . In fact ,
the Company was discovered to
have registers of the roasting to death of 2 5
other people
during the sixteenth century, and some of these
“ solemn
acts of justice were aggravated by atrocious cruelty.

night ,
the Comforters and the chaplain assembled at
S . Ursula and went to the prison in the Tower of Nona ,
entered the chapel

them was consigned the man Giordano Bruno,

firm throughout and to the end in his accursed obstinacy,
setting his brain and mind to a thousand errors and vain
gloryi ngs ; and he continued steadfastly stubborn while
conducted by the Servants of Justice to the Field of
Flowers ( Campo di Fi ori
), and there being stripped and
bound to a stake, was burned alive . Throughout, our

that which is divine in the universe .
’” 1 Schopp, writing
to his Protestant friend Conrad Rittershausen,
this very I 7th
February, 1600,
tells him that when the heretic was led to
the stake to-day, although already dying, when the crucifix
was held out to him, he turned his face aside in disdain .
”
At last he had come at the actual worth of dialectic doublings
and gloz ings and of an official Religion of Love . He had
done with all that now, mocked by the imbecile z ealots who,
almost from Calvary, have converted the symbol of self
s acrifi ce into an engine for letting loose all the devils that
lurk in the human bosom to rage and rend .
He had sung of despising death ;
2 he had written of
being so deeply possessed by other thoughts as not to feel
the last agony .
” 3 That he was victor over the grave we
know ;
that S upreme confidence in a rational universe so
filled his soul that his senses were dead to the torment of
the stake, we may piously hope .
So closed a life marked by supreme unity of purpose— to
know the truth and declare it .
He perished in jubilee year. The men of all countries
flocked to Rome . Fifty cardinals were assembled there .
Processions ,
confessions , kneelings at altars went on all
day . Rome resounded with penitential psalms . Trades
men and harlots did a busy trade . Men went along the
broad new streets and marvelled at them and at the new
cut by which Six tus V had joined the Lateran with the
Vatican at the new population where a waste had existed

excitement thrown in with the other allurements of a holiday .
The culprit made his painful way over the tufa stones with
bared feet . He was chained by the neck and wore a white
sheet emblaz oned at the corners with the cross of St . Andrew
and illuminated here and there with devils and red flames .
He was accompanied by a procession of priests ,
singing
litanies, exhorting him to repent, and thrusting the crucifix
to his hps the Brotherhood carried torches and the officials
of the Governor of Rome acted as guard . Arrived at the
Open S pace where the fashionable frivolity of the ancient
city was once wonted to crowd into the Theatre of Pompey,
the ruins of which still guarded the Field of Flowers , all the
rabble of Rome who now dwelt around it were assembled
at this
“ Roman holiday . Narducci discovered at the
Vatican that the precise spot where Bruno was burned
was in front of a house at the corner of the Campo di Fiori
and the Vicolo Bales trari
, where there is a stone inscribed
with Latin verses and put up by the Superintendent of
Streets in the fifteenth century

’
s small par t in it was forgotten , almost
from the moment when,
in accordance with the official
direction concerning heretics, his ashes were scattered to
the winds .
The strange delay in dealing effectively with him was
repeated in the case of his wr1ti n gs . They were not placed
on the Index until 2 5 years later (Aug. 7th, Since in
Catholic Countries the possessor of proscribed works placed
himself in grave peril, original specimens have become very
rare . His books never achieved popularity . The English
deists who rediscovered him in the early part of the
eighteenth century tried to make much of him and failed .

His name practically disappeared . Then ,
in the vigorous
youth of German Philosophy, Jacobi recognised his genius ,
and this was generally acknowledged by German thinkers ,
though his works were not closely studied . Hegel and
Schelling found in him a kindred spirit . In 1 847 a French
man , Christian Bartholmes s ,
furnished with scanty material
laboriously collected, attempted a biography and gave the
world a well-considered criticism of his published works .
Since then ,
in Germany, France, England and especially in
Italy,
research has been made and valuable monographs
have appeared . During his researches, Ranke came across
a portion of the rec ord of the trial at Venice . Valuable
documents were afterwards discovered and scholars,
such
as Fiorentino , Berti and Tocco, devoted years to the examina
tion of Bruno
’
s life and works . After the unification of Italy,
his countrymen caught fire . A complete edition of his writ
ings ,
including unprinted manuscripts, was issued volume
by volume . For a time there was a veritable Brunoman i a .
”
The man more God-intoxicated than Spinoz a even , was
hailed in the eighties by materialists and monists and hide
bound scientists claiming to be metaphysicians as their
harbinger in the 16th century. The general enthusiasm
reached its climax on the 9th June 1 889 . Thirty thousand
folk assembled, most of whom could never have read Bruno
or have formed any sound judgment as to his merits : they
only knew he had been martyred by the Papacy . And to
the ordinary Roman , who from time immemorial has never
been able to abide a Pope or subsist without one,
that was
occasion enough . All followed the Syndic to the Field of
Flowers , where a monument had been erected to the
memory of yet another great Italian ; and this statue of
the Nolan was unveiled . There was much feasting, and
the guests hurried from dinner back to the monument to
illuminate it . It is said that Leo XIII fasted throughout
308 GIORDANO BRUNO
fi ci ency in those self-regarding v irtues which we hold in so
high esteem to-day. On e of the most original thinkers , or
rather let us say, one of the most penetrative of seers ,
that
gift of practical wisdom in the conduct of his own life which
makes the safe and successful man , was Wi thheld from him .
He experienced little but protracted buffetings fi om adverse
fate . And the man who,
in many respects , marched genera
tions ahead of his fellows had the evil fortune to influence
directly only one great thinker . But that thinker was
Baruch de Spinoz a, and , after all,
to influence Baruch de
Spinoz a was much . And the intrepid constancy of the
martyr for the right to think is more . It raises the human
measure for faithfulness and strengthens reverence for what
is of highest and best in man . Bruno fell like a first blossom
of spring ,
foredoomed to be withered ,
to fail of its function
and to fall . But it is the promise of a thousand to follow,
which shall not fail but fructify.
